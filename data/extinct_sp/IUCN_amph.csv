16935685,54837,"Nectophrynoides asperginis","ANIMALIA","CHORDATA","ANURA","AMPHIBIA","BUFONIDAE","Extinct in the Wild","2004",2015,"7/25/2014",3.1,"English","This species was listed as Extinct in the Wild (EW) in 2009 because no self-sustaining population existed in the wild at that time. The 2014 assessment is observing the five year rule set out in section 2.2.1 of the Guidelines for Using the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria, which requires a species to remain in its original category for a time period of five years from the time it no longer meets the criteria for that category (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2014). As reintroductions began in 2013, the species will require reassessment in 2018. This five-year time period will allow for monitoring of the species' recovery and the viability of its re-introduced population.","This species lived only in soaked herbaceous vegetation in the spray zone of the Kihansi Falls. An artificial gravity-fed sprinkler system is currently in place to mimic the original conditions of the spray zone. The toad breeds by internal fertilization, with females retaining the larvae internally in the oviduct until little toadlets are born. Clutch size varies from 5–13 offspring (Channing et al. 2006).","The serious decline and extinction of this species appears tp be related to the Lower Kihansi Hydropower Project, which involved the construction of a dam upstream on the Kihansi River in 2000. The dam cut off 90% of the original water flow to the gorge, thereby hugely reducing the volume of spray, particularly in the dry season, as well as altering the vegetational composition. An artificial gravity-fed sprinkler system was set up to mimic the natural spray of the Kihansi ecosystem with the remaining water flow. Unfortunately, the sprinkler system was not ready by the time the water was cut off in 2000, and by the time the sprinklers came on nine months later the ecosystem had already dried up (see Krajick 2006). Later, during the dry season in 2003, the artificial sprinkler system failed for a while. Around this time, the fungal disease chytridiomycosis was confirmed in dead animals of this species, and this disease is probably responsible for the final population crash. It is possible that the drought caused by the failure of the sprinkler system resulted in stress to the animals that rendered them susceptible to the disease. There are also reports that the 2003 crash coincided with a brief opening of the dam's floodgates to flush sediments; tests showed that these contained pesticides used in maize farming operations upstream, in concentrations sufficient to kill the toads (Krajick 2006). The impact of predation by safari ants (Dorylus sp.) and crabs (Potomonautes sp.) is unknown (Channing et al. 2006).","Formerly it was abundant in a tiny area, with a population of around 17,000 individuals. Reports indicate that the species fluctuated naturally in its population size. The population appeared to be at a high in May 1999, dropping to lower numbers in the course of 2001 and 2002 [total population estimates oscillated at around 11,000 individuals up until March 2002; see Channing et al. 2006], and at a high again in June 2003 [a total population estimate of 20,989 individuals; Channing et al. 2006]. However, subsequently the population went into steep decline, and by mid-January 2004, only three individuals could be seen and just two males were heard calling. There were a few records of calling animals during the rest of 2004, and an unconfirmed report from May 2005 (CBSG 2007), but there were no records of any individuals in subsequent years, despite surveys, leading to the species being listed as Extinct in the Wild in May 2009.In an effort to re-introduce the species into the wild, Toledo and Bronx Zoos have been conducting an ex situ breeding programme. In June 2012 1,000 toads were involved in release experiments (where some were retained in a captive facility at Kihansi and a few were sent to the gorge). In October 2012 2,000 toads were re-introduced back to the gorge. In October 2013 2,000 toads were involved in several activities (where some were kept at Kihansi captive breeding facility, some were used for release experiments and some were re-introduced back to the gorge). There is a plan to re-introduce another 2,000 toads to the wild probably in October 2014 (W. Ngalason  pers. comm. July 2014).","This species was a micro-endemic of the Kihansi Falls, in the Kihansi Gorge, in the Udzungwa Mountains, eastern Tanzania, at 600-940 m asl. Its global range covered an area of less than two hectares around the Kihansi Falls, and searches for it around other waterfalls on the escarpment of the Udzungwa Mountains have not located any additional populations (Channing et al. 2006).","In 2000, at the invitation of the Tanzanian government, the Bronx Zoo collected 499 individuals to establish an ex-situ breeding programme in view of creating an assurance population.","Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)","This toad is not known from any protected areas. Sufficient minimum bypass flow from the dam is required to maintain the spray habitat and an artificial sprinkler system is in place to provide these conditions - this is especially important in the dry season. Captive breeding is ongoing in Toledo and New York Bronx Zoos, and a captive population was established at the University of Dar es Salaam in 2010. Soft-release experiments, as well as full re-introduction, are ongoing and the reintroduced population is under regular monitoring. It is listed on CITES Appendix I.","Afrotropical","Global"

It was last seen in 1990, and exhaustive surveys at the species' known sites and the only other adjacent site with suitable habitat at suitable elevations have failed to record the species in several decades. The species experienced drastic population declines, probably due to chytridiomycosis and habitat loss, and has apparently not recuperated.","This species lived on the ground along mountain streams in premontane and lower montane moist forest. It presumably bred by direct development, with eggs laid on land, similar to other species in the Craugastor rugulosus series (McCranie and Castaneda 2007). It was not though to have tolerated habitat disturbance.","Species of the Craugastor rugulosus group appear to have undergone dramatic declines between mid 1980s to early 1990s across Honduras, including within undisturbed habitat which is a strong indicator of chytrid-related declines (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019). Chytridiomycosis is thought to have contributed to the extinction of this species (J. Townsend, L. Herrera and J. Kolby pers. comm. March 2019), as well as habitat loss and degradation caused by agricultural encroachment, wood extraction, forest fires, water pollution, and landslides. The type locality of this species was already within a disturbed area of human settlement (J. Townsend pers. comm. March 2019). The second locality, Rio Arcaqual, is affected at lower elevations by a small dam that is undergoing increased use pressure by local communities; and if the species was still present, then it is thought that this would be a threat to it (L. Herrera, J. Townsend and H. Vega pers. comm. March 2019).Highland amphibians are adapted to inhabit a narrow climatic envelope. Changes in climate are expected to reduce the available suitable habitat and required microclimates. Rapid shifts in the climatic conditions required by these species would not allow sufficient opportunity for adaptation, especially in light of the limited possibility for elevational migration. Tropical Montane Cloud Forest (&gt;1,000 m asl) has been demonstrated to be negatively affected by climatic changes to a greater extent than other habitats (Foden et al. 2013, Wicaksono et al. 2017, Lyra et al. 2017, Neate-Clegg et al. 2018). An increase in high rainfall events is being observed throughout its range, as well as an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events (hurricanes and droughts) in the Caribbean, destroying the riparian habitat required by stream-dwelling and stream-associated amphibian species (Honduras Amphibian Red List Workshop March 2019). Climate change is therefore considered to be both a current and future threat to all amphibian species in this habitat type. Furthermore, amphibians globally are at an increased risk of disease (e.g. chytridiomycosis) and a decline in fecundity due to such changes (Pounds et al. 2006, Blaustein et al. 2010).","It had always been extremely rare, and is now considered to be extinct. Surveys were conducted for this species in 1995 and 1997, and no individuals were found (McCranie and Castaneda 2007). A two-night survey was conducted in 2008 at the type locality and did not record this species, and a 12 day survey (involving nine people for three days, and five people for the remaining six days) was conducted in 2015 that specifically looked for the two endemic amphibians on this mountain within suitable elevation range (including areas not previously surveyed for amphibians), and did not find the species (J. Townsend pers. comm. March 2019). Mapance NGO have conducted monthly biodiversity surveys since 2015, surveying from the visitor centre up the mountain which includes the second site that this species is known from for which there have been no records (H. Vega pers. comm. March 2019).  Furthermore, in 2017 and 2018 survey work was conducted in Volcan Pacayita, which is the only adjacent area with suitable habitat for the species; and no records of the species were found (F. Castañeda pers. comm.

The froglets were then regurgitated through the female's mouth.","The cause(s) of the population decline remain unknown. McDonald (1990) found no obvious evidence that seasonal rarity, over-collecting, predation, drought, floods, habitat destruction, disease, heavy parasite loads or stress due to handling for data collection were responsible for the population declines. Threats to the Eungella National Park include fires that might sweep up the slopes of the mountain during harvesting of the sugar cane in the fields below (Winter and McDonald 1986). Successive fires extend deeper into the rainforest leaving grassy ridges that are devoid of trees (Winter and McDonald 1986). The rainforest is extremely narrow in places and continual fire might eventually erode away entire sections of the forest or fragment the forest (Winter and McDonald 1986). Weeds that encroach on the edges of the forest pose a similar threat (Winter and McDonald 1986). It was thought that it might have been possible that the decline that was observed in 1984–1985 was a natural population fluctuation and that residual individuals had retreated to hidden refuges (Winter and McDonald 1986; McDonald 1990). The extent of such population fluctuations is unknown, but there is evidence of large swings in numbers of other Australian frogs (McDonald 1990). However, despite continued efforts to locate the species, it has not been recorded within Eungella National Park or any other locations since March 1985 (Ingram and McDonald 1993; Richards, McDonald and Alford 1993; Hero et al. 1998, 2002; McDonald and Alford 1999). Eungella National Park is subject to weed invasion on the edges of the reserve (Winter and McDonald 1986). From what is known from similar declines and disappearance elsewhere in the world, chytridiomycosis (present in at least some rainforest streams at Eungella) must be suspected as the most likely cause of the extinction of this species. The Eungella Torrent Frog (Taudactylus eugellensis), which inhabited the same streams, was actively preyed upon by Rhobatrachus vitellinus (Winter and McDonald 1986) and suffered a steep population decline around the same time as R. vitellinus was discovered to have traces of infection from the chytrid fungus (McDonald 1990, Rettalick et al. 2004). Taudactylus eugellensis has been implicated as a host and reservoir for the chytrid fungus (Rettalick et al. 2004) so it is therefore very likely that transmission of the fungus occurred between these species.","The species was considered common across its range until January 1985 when the first signs of decline (reported by Winter and McDonald 1986) were observed at lower altitudes (about 400 m asl) (McDonald 1990). At higher altitudes the frogs remained common until March 1985, but were absent in June of that year (McDonald 1990). Despite continued efforts to locate the species, it has not been recorded again within Eungella National Park or any other locations (Ingram and McDonald 1993, McDonald and Alford 1999, Meyer et al. 2020). Most recently, between 2000–2015 surveys targeting this species and other endemics in the region at 114 sites within Eungella National Park and adjoining State Forest found no trace of the species. This species is considered to be extinct.","This Australian endemic species was discovered in January 1984 (Mahony et al. 1984) and was found exclusively in undisturbed rainforest in Eungella National Park, mid-eastern Queensland at altitudes of 400–1,000 m asl (Covacevich and McDonald 1993). The extent of occurrence (EOO) of the species was less than 150 km2 as calculated using the localities in McDonald (1990).","There was no use or trade of this species.","Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)","Conservation Actions In-PlaceIts known range was within Eungella National Park.

This species experienced a very rapid decline in the wild, from being common to extinct in just a few years, most likely due to chytridiomycosis. Extensive searches in the following 25 years failed to locate this species. There are fewer targeted searches for this species now that considerable time has passed since an individual was last seen in the wild.","This species lived in rainforest, wet sclerophyll forest and riverine gallery open forest at 350 m asl and was closely associated with watercourses and adjacent rock pools and soaks (Czechura 1991, Meyer et al. 2001). These streams are mostly perennial, but in extremely dry years they may cease to flow (Ingram 1983). The vegetation along the stream banks is usually closed forest or tall closed forest with emergent eucalypts, although there are some sites in open forest with grassy ground cover (Ingram 1983). In spring and summer individuals were usually found in or at the edge of rock pools, either amongst leaf-litter, under and between stones or in crevices around the edge (Ingram 1983). The species was also found under rock in shallow water in backwaters and also the main flow of permanent watercourses (Ingram 1983, Czechura 1991). Searches of popular sites in winter only recovered two frogs and it is assumed that the species hibernated in deep crevices in rocks or spaces between rocks underwater during the colder months (Ingram 1983). Adult males tended to prefer deeper pools, whereas females and juveniles may have moved to newly created pools after rain as long as these pools contained stones and/or leaf-litter (Ingram 1983). The prerequisite for the use of pools by this species seemed to be that the pool must be deep enough for the frog to be able to sit with its head out of the water and be able to safely submerge (Ingram 1983). Individuals would only sit fully exposed on the rocks during light rain (Ingram 1983). The species was never recorded from cleared riparian habitat.Breeding activity occurred between October and December (Ingram 1983). Males called from rock crevices above pools (Ingram 1983). Females brood young within their stomach and gave birth through the mouth (Tyler and Carter 1982). Fertilized eggs or early stage larvae were presumably swallowed by the female and completed their development in the stomach (Tyler and Carter 1982). The number of eggs in gravid females (approximately 40) exceeded the number of juveniles found to occur in the stomach (21–26) (Tyler 1989). It is not known whether or not the excess eggs were digested by the female or whether or not they were simply not swallowed (Tyler 1989). The production of hydrochloric acid in the stomach of the female ceased during brooding (Tyler et al. 1983). Tadpoles developed in a manner similar to the aquatic tadpoles of other species though, as they fed off egg yolk, the labial teeth were absent and the intestines formed at a later stage of development (Tyler 1989). After 6–7 weeks the females gave birth to up to 25 young (Tyler and Davies 1983a). Young emerged from the female’s mouth as fully formed frogs and after four days the digestive tract returned to normal and the female recommenced feeding (Tyler and Davies 1983b). Ingram (1983) reported minimum brooding periods from two individuals of 36 and 43 days and suggested that the duration was such that females were unlikely to breed twice in one season.","The reason(s) for the disappearance of this species remains unknown (Tyler and Davies 1985). Populations were present in logged catchments between 1972 and 1979. Although the species persisted in the streams during these activities, the effects of timber harvesting on this aquatic species were never investigated. Its habitat is currently threatened by feral pigs, invasion of weeds (especially Mistflower Ageratina riparia), and altered flow and water quality due to upstream disturbances (Hines et al. 1999). However, from what is known from similar declines and disappearances elsewhere in the world, the disease chytridiomycosis must be suspected.","When first discovered, this species was extremely abundant and common. The species declined rapidly and disappeared at about the same time as a sympatric species Taudactylus diurnus (Czechura and Ingram 1990). Czechura and Ingram (1990) and Ingram (1990) state that the last frog was seen in the wild in 1979 on the Conondale Range. However, Richards et al. (1993) reported the existence of a specimen taken from the Blackall Range in September 1981. Despite intensive searching, the species has not been located since (Ingram and McDonald 1993, Hines et al. 1999). In the laboratory, the last known individual died in November 1983 (Tyler and Davies 1985b). Ingram (1983) studied a population of the species in the headwaters of Booloumba Creek, Conondale Range, and estimated that approximately 78 were present in 1976. No other estimates of population size are available for the species. This species is believed to be extinct.","This Australian endemic species was restricted to elevations between 350 and 800 m asl in the Blackall and Conondale Ranges in southeast Queensland (Hines et al. 1999) with a geographic distribution of less than 1,400 km2 (map in Hines et al. 1999). It inhabited streams in the catchments of the Mary, Stanley and Mooloolah River (Ingram 1983). It was thought to have been first found in 1972 (Liem 1973), but Ingram (1991) reported a specimen collected in 1914 from the Blackall Range.","This species was the subject of research in to its unique breeding ecology.

This species experienced very rapid declines, from being relatively common to extinct at each known locality within just a year or so, most likely due to chytridiomycosis.","This species was a rainforest specialist, endemic to the Wet Tropics Bioregion (Williams and Hero 1998, 2001), and found in upland rainforest and wet sclerophyll forest along fast-flowing streams where there is white water from riffles and cascades (Liem 1974, McDonald 1992). It was usually found perched on rocks or overhanging vegetation adjacent to the water (Liem 1974). Little is known about the life history of this species. Mating calls were heard from October to March (Liem 1974). From 86–90 large unpigmented eggs (1.9–2.5mm diameter) were laid under rocks in riffles (Richards 1993, Hero and Fickling 1996). Richards (1992) described the tadpole and noted that it was one of the few species of tadpole known to exhibit adaptations to torrent environments of Australia, including a streamlined body shape, large suctorial mouthparts and muscular tail. Tadpoles commonly overwintered in upland streams, although those hatching in early summer could metamorphose before the next autumn (Richards 1992).","This species is one of seven frogs occurring in upland rainforest streams in northeastern Queensland that experienced substantial range contractions and population declines between 1988 and late 1994 (Ingram and McDonald 1993, Richards et al. 1993, Northern Queensland Threatened Frogs Recovery Team 2001). These species share the common characteristics of having a high degree of habitat specialisation, and reproduction in fast flowing streams (Williams and Hero 1998). The declines are believed to be caused by the amphibian chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) (Northern Queensland Threatened Frogs Recovery Team 2001) although dead or dying individuals of this species specifically were not found (Berger et al. 1999).Richard et al. (1993) rejected drought, floods, habitat destruction, or pollution by pesticides, inorganic ions or heavy metals as possible causes of the decline. The habitat of the species in the Wet Tropics has been protected since 1988; therefore, habitat destruction as a result of logging was no longer a threat (McDonald and Alford 1999). Feral pigs were a potential cause of riparian habitat damage and adult frog mortality (Richards et al. 1993). The activity of feral pigs has been recorded to have increased over the period 1989–1992 in an area previously inhabited by this species (Richards et al. 1993).","This species was once moderately common in suitable habitat, but then experienced a catastrophic decline. Adults were last recorded in April 1990, and tadpoles and metamorphs were last recorded in November 1990 on the Carbine Tableland (Richards et al. 1993). However, this species had apparently disappeared from sites on the Atherton Tableland much earlier (Richards et al. 1993). It was recorded from various sites on the Atherton Tableland prior to 1973 (Liem 1974), but was not encountered in Danbulla State Forest during 1989–1992 or at any Atherton Tableland site during surveys conducted between 1991 and 1992 (Richards et al. 1993). Surveys in the Wet Tropics conducted in 1991−1992, 1993 and 2011−2013 failed to locate the species from a number of historic locations and other potentially suitable habitat (Ingram and McDonald 1993, Richards et al. 1993, Trenerry et al. 1994, Hoskin and Puschendorf 2014), and Hoskin and Puschendorf (2014) concluded that the Mountain Mistfrog could be considered extinct. The Conservation Advice published for this species summarises the extensive survey efforts from 1989 to 2013 that were unsuccessful in locating any extant populations (Threatened Species Scientific Committee 2019). Gillespie et al. (2020) have now declared this species extinct.","This Australian endemic species was distributed across two thirds of the Wet Tropics from Douglas Creek near Cardwell to Alexandra Creek, Thornton Peak in northeast Queensland (Hero and Fickling 1994) at altitudes between 380 and 1,020 m asl (McDonald 1992).","There was no use or trade of this species.","Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)","Conservation Actions In-PlaceThe habitat of the species in the Wet Tropics has been protected since 1988.

The species was seen on rocks during the day near swift-flowing streams or in the rainforest leaf-litter during wet weather (McDonald 1992). Males called during the day, from first light to early evening, near rainforest streams from beneath rocks or leaves (McDonald 1992). Males appeared to establish territories, possibly as a response to seemingly low numbers of females (Dennis 1982). Breeding was observed from late November through to January (Liem and Hosmer 1973). Eggs were laid as a gelatinous clump of about 25–40 eggs (2.2–2.7mm diameter) amongst rocks in the water usually in heavily shaded locations (Liem and Hosmer 1973). Liem and Hosmer (1973) described the tadpole of the species as lotic benthic. Tadpoles generally inhabited debris in pools or slow flowing sections of streams (Liem and Hosmer 1973).","Richards et al. (1993) found no obvious evidence that drought, floods, habitat destruction or pollution by pesticides, inorganic ions or heavy metals were responsible for the population declines seen in this species. Big Tableland, the area where the species was at its highest density in 1991–1992, has been mined since 1887 and logging ceased in that area in 1963 (Richards et al. 1993). Rather, research suggests the rapid, catastrophic decline of this species was due to infection with chytridiomycosis (Berger et al. 1999, Schloegel et al. 2006). Chytrid fungus has been identified on specimens of this species from the Carbine Tableland and Big Tableland (Speare and Berger 2000).Feral pigs are a potential cause of riparian habitat damage and adult frog mortality (Richards et al. 1993). The activity of feral pigs has been recorded to have increased over the period 1989–1992 in an area previously inhabited by this species (Richards et al. 1993). There is very little research, however, into the impact of feral pigs on native frog populations (Richards et al. 1993).","Formerly a conspicuous inhabitant of upland rainforest streams because of its diurnal habits and historical abundance, the species started disappearing in the southern part of its range in 1988 and had disappeared from south of the Daintree River by 1992 (Richards et al. 1993). In the past the species was considered locally abundant and in 1989, 48 calling males were recorded along a 100 m stream transect (Richards et al. 1993). When surveys of the same site were undertaken in 1990, only one adult and several tadpoles were located (Richards et al. 1993). The rapid decline of this species is well documented and, in approximately five years from 1988 to 1993, it disappeared from an area spanning about 2.5 degrees latitude (Ingram 1993). Possible sightings of a single individual in a small tributary of the South Johnstone River in 1996 (Marshall 1998), and in 1997, a gravid female seen near Mount Hartley (Hero et al. 1998), are the only records of the species since 1994 (Hero et al. 2002, Schloegel et al. 2006). Apart from these two individuals, it has not been recorded during extensive searches of suitable, known sites from the previous range of this species between 1994 and 2004 (Hero and McDonald, personal communication in Schloegel et al. 2006), and more recent extensive surveys in the region have still failed to find any individuals and it is now believed that this species is extinct (Conrad Hoskin pers. comm. 2016, Gillespie et al. 2020).","This Australian endemic species was widely distributed from Mount Graham to the Big Tableland, in northeast Queensland, at altitudes of 300–1,300 m asl (McDonald 1992).","There was no use or trade of this species.","Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)","Conservation Actions In-PlaceIts historical range included Lumholtz, Wooroonooran, Daintree, Crater, Cedar Bay, and Tully Falls National Parks, as well as Qld Timber Reserve (165 Monkhouse), Lamb Range, Malbon Thompson Range, Herberton Range, Ravenshoe, Kirrama Range, Mt Fisher, Maalan, Mt Lewis, and Windsor State Forests (Tyler 1997). There was a captive-rearing programme run by the Melbourne Zoo and the Queensland Department of the Environment, that started in 1996.

In addition, animals were also found along watercourses in pure stands of the palm Archontophoenix cunninghamia, in exposed areas, in gorges, in dense non-forest riparian vegetation (Lomandra longifolia, Carex neurochlamys, Elatostema reticulatum and Blechnum nudum) and where the riparian vegetation had been slightly infested with Lantana camara (Czechura and Ingram 1990). Permanent streams with rocky substrates were favoured, but this species also occurred in permanent and ephemeral streams on gravel, clay, sand and soil substrates (Czechura and Ingram 1990). Active frogs had been observed all year round, although less frequently during winter months (Czechura and Ingram 1990). Breeding occurred in warm weather after or during heavy rain from late October to May, with a January to March peak (Czechura and Ingram 1990, Meyer et al. 2001). Gravid females had been reported between November and May (Straughan and Lee 1966). Amplexus was inguinal and 24–36 eggs (2.2 mm diameter) were deposited in gelatinous clumps under rocks or branches in the water (Liem and Hosmer 1973, Watson and Martin 1973, Czechura and Ingram 1990, Meyer et al. 2001). Tadpoles, illustrated by Liem and Hosmer (1973) and Watson and Martin (1973), were found throughout the year.","The reason(s) for the disappearance of this species remains unknown. Like Rheobatrachus silus, logging has occurred in catchments occupied by the species (Hines et al. 1999); however, the effect of timber harvesting on the species has not been investigated. The species’ habitat is currently threatened by feral pigs, invasion of weed species (especially Mist Flower) and altered stream flow and water quality due to upstream disturbances (Hines et al. 1999). The species was not found in areas along watercourses that were heavily infested with Lantana camara or where the weeds Baccharis halimifolia and Ageratina riparia (Mist Flower) occurred (Czechura and Ingram 1990). The frogs were also absent from streams with very muddy water associated with the activities of feral pigs (Czechura and Ingram 1990). From what is known from similar declines and disappearance elsewhere in the world, the disease chytridiomycosis also must be suspected as a cause for the decline.","In the early 1970s this species was considered to be relatively common (McEvoy et al. 1979), but following a very rapid decline it has not been sighted in the wild since 1979 despite continued efforts to relocate the species (Hines et al. 1999). The disappearance of the species occurred over a period of three to four years, disappearing from the D’Aguilar Range in late 1975, then from the Blackall Range in late 1978, and finally from the Conondale Range in early 1979 (Czechura and Ingram 1990). There is no information on population size, structure, genetics or dynamics (Hines et al. 1999).

Although a wild population has since been reintroduced into its native range, a self-sustaining breeding population has not successfully been re-established, and the species is entirely reliant on intensive management and the release of captive-bred individuals for successful recruitment.","Historically, this species is associated with floodplain ponds along the Big and Little Laramie Rivers. It is known to inhabit a variety of wetland habitats, including lakes, ponds, streams, marshes, and roadside ditches (Green et al. 2014). The use of lakes might have been limited due to saline conditions, however it is possible that irrigation might have flushed out the lakes and made them more suitable for toads (G. Baxter pers. comm.). Individuals use rodent burrows for shelter, and are inactive during the cold season. Breeding takes place from mid-May to mid-June, and larvae metamorphose by early August. This species is a colonial breeder, although breeding aggregations tend to be small. Adults feed on a variety of small terrestrial arthropods, while larvae eat organic debris, algae, and plant tissue.","This species is particularly at risk due to its extremely limited distribution and small population size, and is is entirely dependent on captive releases for its survival in the wild. A lack of genetic diversity might also limit this species' abundance in the Laramie Basin. The primary threats within its range include the lack of suitable habitat available for future reintroductions within its historic range, and the infectious disease chytridiomycosis caused by the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Mortenson Lake is known to be infected with the amphibian chytrid fungus (Bd) (USFWS 2002). This fungus has been implicated in declines and extinctions of amphibian species worldwide. Retrospective analysis shows that the fungus has been present at Mortenson Lake since at least 1989, and it continues to pose a major threat to this species. In 2003, a die-off of Wyoming toads at Mortenson Lake was attributed to Bd, and results from USFWS surveys conducted from 2008–2010 reported 67–100% Bd positive rates in tested toads (Polasik et al. 2015). In addition, chytridiomycosis has been recorded within the captive population. Additional threats to the species include predation (especially by mustelids), pesticide use, and ongoing irrigation practices. The cause of the original decline remains unknown but might be associated with the invasion of chytrid into the area (USFWS 2002). Mortenson Lake has also experienced ongoing habitat degradation, including becoming more saline (and less suitable for toads) as a result of drought-related increases in evaporation (USFWS 2002e). Additionally, the height and density of vegetation may be greater around Mortenson Lake than it historically was due to decreased intensity of cattle grazing and lack of fire. Previous observations of this species recorded individuals surviving in close association with cattle grazing, so this change in management practices could be causing habitat degradation (Polasik et al. 2015).","This species was common in the 1950s, but underwent a large decline in the 1960s and 1970s. This species was federally listed as endangered in 1984, and was presumed extinct by 1985 (Baxter and Stromberg 1980, Stromberg 1981, Vankirk 1980, Baxter et al. 1982, Baxter and Stone 1985, Lewis et al. 1985). A small extant population consisting of approximately 100–150 adults was discovered at Mortenson Lake in 1987 (Stone 1991), and the population continued to reproduce successfully with all life stages represented until 1989. On September 1, 1989 the last ten remaining individuals were removed from Mortenson Lake and taken into captivity (McCleary 1989, USFWS 2015). Captive breeding began in mid-1990s using the toads taken from Mortenson Lake and reintroduction efforts were started in 1995 (USFWS 2002, 2015). Despite over 20 years of reintroduction efforts (over 187,000 individuals were released from 1995 to 2013), breeding populations of the Wyoming Toad have not re-established (Dodd 2013, Polasik et al. 2015). As of 2017, the population was known to have 1,500 individuals in existence across five sites, with this number experiencing dramatic fluctuations year-to-year (NPR 2017). There is little wild breeding taking place and no breeding activity has been documented in recent years at any of the currently known sites. Thus, none of these populations is currently self-sustaining (USFWS 2015). Despite releases of captive-reared individuals, the population at Mortenson Lake NWR appears to be declining (USFWS 2002).","This species is restricted to the Laramie Basin in Albany County, Wyoming, USA. Historically, this species was commonly found across 1,820 km2 of the Laramie Basin. It was presumed extinct by 1985 (Baxter and Stromberg 1980, Stromberg 1981, Vankirk 1980, Baxter et al. 1982, Baxter and Stone 1985, Lewis et al. 1985). In 1987, a small remnant population was discovered at Mortenson Lake (Stone 1991). In 1989, all remaining wild individuals from Mortenson Lake were taken into captivity, and reintroduction efforts were started in 1995 (McCleary 1989, USFWS 2015). All wild-occurring toads are considered to be the product of reintroduction efforts (USFWS 2015). This species' distribution is now restricted to Mortenson Lake National Wildlife Refuge and two private land sites protected under the Wyoming Toad Safe Harbor Agreements (USFWS 2015).

Efforts are being made to establish additional suitable release sites on public lands and private lands protected through Safe Harbor Agreements (USFWS 2002). Bd (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) surveillance and research is ongoing to understand disease dynamics in both the wild and captive population of Wyoming toads. This species is listed as Endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. Conservation NeededIt is recommended that for occupied lakes, emergent and bank vegetation (bulrushes, sedges, grasses, etc.) be managed through grazing, prescribed burning, and mechanical removal, etc. to prevent overgrown vegetation that inhibits the free movement of toads and could potentially alter the thermal environment. A continued focus on captive breeding is required, and it is recommended that awareness and communication programmes surrounding this species' be expanded.Research NeededA better understanding of the life-history, disease dynamics, and ecological needs of the Wyoming Toad is necessary to ensure the effectiveness of the reintroduction program. The success of the recovery programme probably depends on finding some way to combat chytridiomycosis in the wild.","Nearctic","Global"

Both known sites have been destroyed, and catastrophic declines occurred during the 1960s–1980s due to the combined effects of multiple severe threats. Extensive searches in the appropriate habitat, during the appropriate season within the known range, since 1964 have failed to locate this species.","This species occurred in primary forest in the Atlantic Forest biome. It inhabited low vegetation on the border of streams in gallery forest (Bokermann 1963). There is no information on breeding habits, but reproduction might have taken place by larval development in streams. It was a medium-sized treefrog with loud and very characteristic vocalizations, making it easy to detect.","This species disappeared in the late 1960s or 1970s after suffering severe declines due to a number of threats. Both known sites have been destroyed by infrastructure development. The type locality was destroyed when the new Estação Ferroviária Campo Grande (railway station) was built in the early 1970s. The second locality was previously on the outskirts of the city of Sao Paulo, and was destroyed by significant urban expansion that took place during the middle of the last century (1950s–1970s) and continues to this day. This site is currently a parking lot (P. Garcia pers. comm. 2021).However, the Serra da Paranapiacaba still contains a large extent of  intact, suitable forest habitat and the species likely occurred at other sites within the Serra, and between the Serra and the city of Sao Paulo. It is the synergistic effects of pollution, disease, and habitat degradation that are suspected to have caused the species' extinction where habitat loss did not (Carvalho et al. 2017). The coastal city of Cubatão is highly industrialized and contains oil and gas refineries, chemical manufacturing plants, and other industrial activities. It infamously caused severe air pollution in the city of Sao Paulo in the 1970s and 1980s. The resulting acid rain caused changes in forest cover and humidity in the forests of the Serra da Paranapiacaba and Serra do Mar (Brazilian Red List Assessment Workshop 2021). The amphibian chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), is thought to have arrived in the Serra do Mar in the 1970s or 1980s (Carvalho et al. 2017). The overlap in the timing of these threats, and their extreme severity, are thought to have caused rapid declines across the entire distribution.","This species is known from five individuals collected in 1962 from the type locality (Bokermann 1963, Lutz 1973, Faivovich et al. 2021). Only one individual is known from the Nova Manchester locality and was identified from museum collections by Faivovich et al. (2021); it is presumed to have also been collected in the 1960s although there is no collection date provided with the museum records. The only known recording of this species' call was made by Bokermann in 1963 at the type locality (Faivovich et al. 2021).Dozens of targeted surveys back to the type locality have taken place since 1963 by experienced researchers, including W.C.A. Bokermann who collected the type series, but all were unsuccessful (Brazilian Red List Assessment Workshop 2021). The Serra de Paranapiacaba is the type locality of many other species, and occurs within the broader Serra do Mar of Sao Paulo State, which has been subject to hundreds of surveys over the decades. The second site was on the outskirts of the city of Sao Paulo in the 1960s, but has since been engulfed by urbanisation and has been destroyed. Population declines are inferred to have taken place throughout the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. The species is extinct at both known sites and is estimated to have gone extinct in the wider Serra da Paranapiacaba by the end of the 1980s as a result of catastrophic declines caused by the synergistic effects of multiple severe threats.","This Brazilian species was known from only two sites: one at the Estação Ferroviária de Campo Grande (type locality) in the municipality of Santo André within the Serra de Paranapiacaba (Bokermann 1963); and another about 35 km away in the district of Nova Manchester in the municipality of São Paulo, in the state of São Paulo (Faivovich et al. 2021). The type locality is between 600 and 800 m asl.","There are no records of the species being utilized.","Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)","Conservation Actions In-PlaceThe national red list declared this species as Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct) in 2014 (Haddad et al. 2016). The ICMBio/RAN Workshop of 2018 declared the species Extinct; the publication of this listing is forthcoming (Brazilian Red List Assessment Workshop 2021). The species is included in the National Action Plan for the Conservation of Threatened Herpetofauna (Machado et al. 2021). However, it has not been recorded from protected areas and there are no targeted actions in place, but surveys in the Serra da Paranapiacaba still target this species.","Neotropical","Global"

Egg clutches were likely laid as several rows of eggs and deposited outside of the water in rock crevices above the water; eggless capsules were likely present in the egg clutch. After hatching, tadpoles likely developed in these water bodies until metamorphosis (Lutz and Lutz 1939, Izecksohn and Cruz 1976, Heyer et al. 1990, Baêta et al. 2016).","The primary threats suspected of causing major population declines are the synergistic effects of severe air pollution and the amphibian fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Verdade et al. 2011). A similar species, Phrynomedusa dryade has tested positive for Bd infection (Toledo et al. 2006) and could therefore have played a role in the decline and disappearance of this species.The species' submontane slopes in Paranapiacaba face the city of Cubatão, a highly industrialized city containing oil and gas refineries, chemical manufacturing plants, and other industrial activities. Similar to other well-known coastal metropolitan areas bounded by mountains, the city's location at the base of the Serra do Mar trapped the air causing dangerous levels of pollution in the 1970s and 1980s. The smog produced by these industries was blown inland by the sea breeze to the large metropolitan area of São Paulo and the resulting acid rain degraded the rainforest of the Serra do Mar. The impact of this pollution on the environment and human health of inhabitants of Cubatão and São Paulo spawned campaigns that brought about changes to industrial practices that persist to this day. It is therefore not unreasonable to assume that the effects of severe habitat degradation, combined with additional pressure from a pathogen known to have negatively affected many stream-dwelling montane species, caused catastrophic declines in this species during the 1970s and 1980s from which it has not recovered.The habitat in the Serra da Araracuara is intact and not threatened.","The species is known from the holotype collected in 1898 (Miranda-Ribeiro 1923) and one individual collected in the 1950s (D. Baêta  unpubl. data). Despite efforts to rediscover this species, no records in the wild have been made (Trevine et al. 2014, Baêta et al. 2016). A project is underway using eDNA techniques to search for populations of missing amphibian species in Brazil, including this species (D. Baêta pers. comm. 2021).","This Brazilian endemic species is thought to be Extinct. It was known only from the type locality in Alto da Serra (Paranapiacaba), in the municipality of Santo André, São Paulo state, south-eastern Brazil, around 1,000 m asl. Taxonomic revision efforts of the genus Phrynomedusa in historical material deposited in museum collections recently revealed that this species had a wider historical range than is currently known: one individual from Paraná State in the Serra de Araracuara was identified and was previously thought to belong to P. appendiculata (D. Baêta upubl. data).","There are no records of this species being used or traded.","Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)","Conservation Actions In-PlaceHistorically the species occurred in the Parque Estadual Serra do Mar.
