546437,14881,Notropis amecae,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,CYPRINIFORMES,ACTINOPTERYGII,LEUCISCIDAE,Extinct in the Wild,2008,2019,2018-12-05 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is endemic to the upper Río Ameca in Jalisco, Mexico. The species was considered extinct in 2000, but was later found in 2005 and 2008. In 2014, intensive surveys during ten months in the entire range of its distribution, and using different sampling techniques, did not find the species. In 2016, 40 individuals were reintroduced in its native range. Recent surveys have recorded the species there, but it is unclear if the population is viable. Based on this, the species is considered Extinct in the Wild. If the introduced population proves to be viable in the next few years, a reassessment should be conducted and a change in category may be considered.","The species used to occur above 1,300 m Asl, in the channel of Río Ameca and two tributaries, one fed by warm springs with much vegetation (including water hyacinth, green algae, Ceratophyllum, and Potamogeton), in slight, moderate or swift current, over sand, rock, and silt, at depths up to about 1 m (Miller et al. 2005). The Teuchitlán River (tributary fed by springs) has an average width of 6 m, with a bottom of silt, sand, gravel, rocks and boulders (Chernoff and Miller 1986).Spawning probably occurs from early spring to late summer, as suggested by mature adults and appearance of young. A single mature female examined contained 272 eggs (Miller et al. 2005, Soto-Galera and Alcántara-Soria 2007). ","The Teuchitlán River has been subject to destruction and modification resulting from the extraction of water for human consumption (Miller and Fitzsimons 1971, Williams et al. 1989). The river receives domestic drainage, effluents from runoff from agricultural fields of sugar and tequila agave that are subject to frequent applications of pesticides (López-López et al. 2003). In addition, the Ameca River basin is classified as strongly contaminated (Vázquez-Gutiérrez 1994). The exact cause of the population decline is not known but may be related to habitat loss from ground water depletion (López-López and Paulo Maya 2001). There are six introduced species in the Teuchitlán River that may be affecting this species (O. Domínguez Domínguez pers. comm. 2018). Introduced species represent 90% of total biomass and abundance of the species collected in the river (O. Domínguez Domínguez pers. comm. 2018).","Historically, this species was never common. Of 2,895 fishes collected in the upper Ameca river basin between 1939 and 1969, only 46 were N. amecae (Chernoff and Miller 1986). Before 1996 it was considered an extinct species (Hilton-Taylor, 2000). Later, it was reported by López-López and Paulo-Maya (2001) and in 2008 by J. Lyons and P. Gesundheit-Montero (UWZM 12145). In 2014, the entire distribution of the species was surveyed with appropriate methods during ten months (one week each time), and no individuals were collected. In 2016, 40 individuals of this species were re-introduced in Balneario El Rincon (O. Domínguez Domínguez pers. comm. 2018). These individuals come from a captive population of six individuals collected in 2005. The species is still apparently present there, but its population size and trend is not known (O. Domínguez Domínguez pers. comm. 2018).","This species is endemic to Mexico, where it used to occur in the upper part of Río Ameca-Magdalena basin, Jalisco (Miller et al. 2005).",This species is not used or traded.,Freshwater (=Inland waters),"It is currently considered a taxon endangered by the American Fisheries Society (Jelks et al. 2008). It is considered extinct under Mexican law NOM-059-SEMARNAT-2010. In 2016, the species was re-introduced in Balneario El Rincon, but its population is currently not being monitored (O. Domínguez Domínguez pers. comm. 2018). Research is needed to determine the success and viability of the re-introduced population. The species is also being bred in captivity (O. Domínguez Domínguez pers. comm. 2018). Control of introduced species and education and awareness programs of local communities have also been implemented (O. Domínguez Domínguez pers. comm. 2018).

A continuing decline of the species' habitat quality has been reported as a result of water pollution from urban and industrial discharges and agricultural run-off, increased sedimentation, dewatering, and anthropogenic modifications to natural channels and flow regimes due to the construction of large dams within the species distribution range (Harrison &amp; Stiassny 1999,  Jelks, et al. 2008, Garrido et al. 2010).

1998432,191696,Allotoca goslinei,ANIMALIA,CHORDATA,CYPRINODONTIFORMES,ACTINOPTERYGII,GOODEIDAE,Extinct in the Wild,2004,2019,2018-03-07 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Given the fact, that Allotoca goslinei was the dominant fish (ca. 75% proportional abundance) at the last known location of the study by Helmus et al. (2009), and then decreased in numbers since about the year 2000, to a few individuals in 2004, and zero when the habitat was extensively sampled in 2005–2006, it can be inferred that the species has disappeared completely from the wild. With no known location and no known wild population, but several captive populations in Europe, Mexico and the United States, the Banded Allotoca is assessed Extinct in the Wild.","Here is the habitat description from Smith and Miller (1987), slightly modified by Köck in 2018: ""At the type locality, the Río Potrero Grande flows through a steep-walled, twisting canyon of high gradient that is well shaded by willows (Salix spp.) and the canyon walls. The species was taken only from a quiet pool of clear to murky water, that was about 23 m long and 3.2-3.8 m wide, up to 1.2 m deep at the steeply shelving south bank and with a substrate of sand, silt, rocks and boulders. Filamentous algae were abundant, and there were small patches of floating vascular plants. In the dry season the current was slight to nil. This was the terminal pool before the creek emerged from the canyon and dropped precipitously to the Río Ameca. Allotoca goslinei was found primarily in shallow water (15-26 cm) underneath floating plants (water hyacinth, algae, and a Nasturtium-like plant) along the gradually sloping north side of the pool. The largest series came from beneath a single patch of floating plants about 3 m long and extending no more than 1 m into the pool. The water temperature during three visits were 16.4-20 °C from mid-day to late afternoon, mid February to early March. Other fishes taken in the same pool were a Catostomid, Moxostoma mascotae (now: Moxostoma austrinum), a Goodeid, Allodontichthys n. sp. (now: Allodontichthys polylepis) and a Poeciliid, Poeciliopsis infans. Rana sp. was also captured, including tagpoles and adults."" Wischnath (1993) additionally mentioned Ilyodon furcidens being a co-inhabitant. Based on the diet of related species, the Banded Allotoca was most likely feeding on small arthropods in the wild (Domínguez-Domínguez et al. 2002, Doadrio and Domínguez-Domínguez 2004, Webb et al. 2004). Schindler reported to Hieronimus (Hieronimus 1995), that on his visit of the type location in 1988, the water looked very polluted and reminded him more on a sewer than on a pool. The water was turbid, with little visibility, and the fish were caught only incidentally, but all species mentioned by Smith and Miller (1987) were present. Following Hieronimus, the condition of the habitat might be caused by an extremely dry spring in 1988.","Allotoca goslinei was moderately common until the year 2000 at the type location in the Río Potrero Grande. About that year, non native and invasive Green Swordtails (Xiphophorus hellerii) occurred, which invaded the type locality between 2000 and 2004 and increased in abundance while Allotoca goslinei decreased in abundance. The Swordtail is thought to have displaced Allotoca goslinei through competition for prey (Arthington 1989), since the stream habitat quality did not noticeably change (Helmus et al. 2009 unpublished data). Both species likely competed for the same sort of prey (Arthington 1989).","Deduced from inconclusive surveys conducted by Helmus et al. in 2005 and 2006 (Helmus et al. 2009), this species is likely extinct in nature. This can be decided due to the fact that in 2000 Alloctoca goslinei was still the dominant fish at the type locality (ca. 75% proportional abundance), but in extensive samplings of the river five, six years later, no more specimens were found. Based on this, the Banded Allotoca is feared to be Extinct in the Wild (Lyons 2011). A few captive strains do exist in Europe, Mexico and the United States, but all of them are low in numbers and not easy to maintain.","The Banded Allotoca was endemic to the Mexican federal state of Jalisco and historically only known from few collections in the headwaters of the Río Ameca, namely from the type location, the Río Grande (or Río, Arroyo, Potrero Grande about 10 km west of the town of Ameca), and from the Río Cuisillos (1 km east of the train station at Pacana near the Presa La Vega, where it coalesces with the Río Salado forming up the Río Ameca) (Smith and Miller 1987). From this distribution pattern, it can be inferred that it was more widespread in the headwaters of the Río Ameca drainage, but stayed either unnoticed or was very scarce. However, it was eliminated from the Río Ameca by the late 1990's, but remained moderately common in the Río Potrero Grande (Lyons 2011), until non-native swordtails (Xiphophorus hellerii) invaded the river after 2000. Being the dominant species in 2000, with about 75% proportional abundance, the numbers of Allotoca goslinei declined rapidly thereafter, and extensive samplings in 2005 and 2006 didn't show a single individual (Helmus et al. 2009). The last record dates back to 2004 (Lyons 2011).",The Banded Allotoca is not used for consumption and is not a target species for the ornamental fish trade.,Freshwater (=Inland waters),"The Banded Allotoca is included in the international ex-situ breeding project ""Allotoca-Mesa Central"" from the Austrian Association of Aquarists (ÖVVÖ) for all species of the genera Allotoca and Neoophorus (http://www.oevvoe.org/allotoca-mesa-central). Other conservation effort is a monitoring and ex-situ breeding project run by the Laboratorio de Biología Acuatica in Michoacan University, Morelia, MexicoNo other conservation efforts for this species are known. ",Neotropical,Global

It disappeared from the type location even before it was described due to habitat alteration by river fragmentation, water pollution, competition through non-native fish (Xiphophorus maculatus) and through destruction of the embankment by live stock, leading to a complete disappearance of habitat. From the El Molino pond, it was extirpated by a heavy drought in 2010. Taking into consideration that no wild population has been known for at least eight years, the species is assessed Extinct in the Wild. ","The former habitat was a quiet, thermal and clear to murky water with only a slight current. The substrate was deep mud with a few rocks, silt and sand. A few species of aquatic plants were present, comprising Eichhornia, Pistia, Ceratophyllum and Potamogeton. The Golden Skiffia prefered depths of less than 0.5 m. Miller and Fitzsimons measured water temperatures between 24 and 26 °C in February 1976 (Miller 2005). The gut is about two to three times the length of the fish. Kingston documented the content, mainly pennate diatoms, some filamentous algae, one small snail and a few pollen grains. The teeth are mainly bifid in both rows. This species definitively grazes on aufwuchs and algae on vertical structures. Another indication for this feeding behaviour are the upturned lips and the wedge-shaped head.The Balneario El Rincón is a trapezium shaped spring with clear water and ground of sand and silt. The width is about 12 m, the length is about 25 m long. There is an outlet into a dammed section of the Teuchitlán river used as cattle trough, and another outlet draining to the subsequent section of the river. The depth of the spring is around 1 m, the walls are concrete but bordered inwards partly with big rocks. In the east angle arises the main spring under the roots of a large Metasequoia tree. ","The species has disappeared from the wild. The biggest threat to a wild population will be non-native fish species. Several exotic species have been introduced near the type locality resulting in declines in native fishes within the Río Teuchitlán (Miller 2005). Meanwhile, exotic species (Oreochromis sp., Xiphophorus hellerii, Poecilia mexicana, Pseudoxiphophorus bimaculatus) make up to 95% of the individuals in the spring area of Teuchitlán (Medina-Nava et al. 2017). A study revealed that densities of Goodeid species were lower or were absent in localities in the Río Teuchitlán, where introduced species were abundant or where there were more than one introduced species (De La Vega-Salazar et al. 2003b). The river has been degraded due to the construction of the La Vega Dam and it is suggested that habitat degradation may have been the cause of the extant endemic Goodeids now being confined to a small area at the headwaters of the river. The species was also threatened as consequence of the springs being turned into spas, preventing movement of fish between pools (De La Vega-Salazar et al. 2003a).","This species is believed to be Extinct in the Wild and disappeared from the Río Teuchitlán due to competition from non-native fish, eventually Xiphophorus maculatus, through water pollution and river fragmentation, and modification of the springs into a water recreation area. The subpopulation from the El Molino pond, discovered in 2006, was a victim of a heavy drought in 2010 and became extirpated as well. ","The Golden Skiffia is a freshwater fish species endemic to the Mexican federal state of Jalisco. It was historically only known from the Río Teuchitlán in the Río Ameca headwaters and from the Río Ameca itself about 12 km east of the town of Ameca. Individuals collected from the El Molino pond (in 2006) in the endorheic Laguna de Sayula basin also belong to this species and those from the Presa La Ciénaga (Presa Buenavista), upper Río Ameca drainage, should be Golden Skiffia as well due to the drainage (determined as Skiffia multipunctata in 1963, before Skiffia francesae was described). Specimens from a historical collection (1939) of the Splotched Skiffia by Miller in a river near Santa Cruz de las Flores, endorheic Laguna Atotonilco drainage, probably belonged to Skiffia francesae as well due to the hydrographic history of this basin (Zacoalco paleolake included parts of the upper Río Ameca drainage), but this is uncertain. However, this species disappeared from all of these habitats and only persists in captivity.","The species is not used for human consumption, but targeted in the aquarium trade by a certain degree. In the 1970's a hybrid with Skiffia multipunctata (called ""Black Beauty"") was bred and regionally distributed, but probably disappeared again from the hobby.",Freshwater (=Inland waters),"No reintroduction or conservation actions are currently known for this species, but the Río Teuchitlán and the La Vega Dam are both sites included within a Ramsar site (Ramsar Secretariat Site No.2026, 2009). Although this does not include the Ameca River directly, it is the next extent of the water flow from these two systems, and so any conservation actions or water quality controls within these water-bodies might continue down stream into the Ameca River.In 2016, the Michoacan University started a reintroduction project for Zoogoneticus tequila and Notropis amecae, both emdemic to the Río Ameca headwaters. The first one, a Goodeid, and the second, a Cyprinid species, inhabited the Río Teuchitlán drainage in historical time, but have been extirpated by unknown reasons. The reintroduction area is focusing on the spring area and the subsequent river sections, mainly the part that is used as a trough, and the schedule includes a complete extraction of non-native fish species from these sections and a long term species control. This action would have a direct positive impact on the Golden Skiffia as exotics represent about 90% of the individuals, so a reintroduction of the species could be successful.",Neotropical,Global

Gibbs unpubl. data), to extinction in the wild on Floreana sometime in the mid 1800s. No genetically pure live Floreana Tortoises are known to exist, although a small number of adults held in captivity contain historical Floreana genetic material, with at least one animal at up to 80% niger genome (Poulakakis et al. 2008, Russello et al. 2010, Garrick et al. 2012). Additionally, genetic analyses have identified many tortoises on Wolf Volcano on northern Isabela that have partial Floreana ancestry. Today an estimated 100 to 200 animals with partial Floreana tortoise ancestry remain on Wolf Volcano; so far 84 individuals have been identified from genetic analyses (Garrick et al. 2012). Although no living pure niger animals are confirmed, the possibility exists that some animals on Wolf Volcano may be genetically pure Floreana Tortoises. Overall, in the absence of confirmed genetically pure animals, Chelonoidis niger should continue to be considered Extinct until documented otherwise. ""Chelonoidis nigra ssp. nigra"" was assessed as Extinct in the 1996 IUCN Red List. This assessment incorporates knowledge contributions from the international workshop on Galápagos tortoises convened by the Galápagos National Park Directorate in July 2012.","No specific information on the habitat preferences and ecology of Chelonoidis niger is available; in all likelihood its biology and diet would have been analogous with other saddlebacked Galápagos tortoise species, a morphological adaptation that increases the vertical range of foraging options, from grazing on herbaceous vegetation to browsing on shrubs and cactus during dry periods when low-growing vegetation  is unavailable.","The precise cause of extinction is not exactly known, but most likely involved a combination of direct exploitation by sailors and settlers, as well as the impacts of invasive species. Historically, Cheloniodis niger was exploited as food by sailors provisioning their ships; a settlement was established on the island by 1829 and later converted to a penal colony; pigs, dogs, cats, goats, donkeys, and cattle were introduced around 1832 with the introduction of Black Rats and house mice likely occurred around the same time.","Based on an estimated average density of one tortoise per hectare of suitable habitat, the pre-human population size was estimated to have been about 8,000 adults (J.P. Gibbs unpubl. data). This species was exposed to intense exploitation by whalers in the early 1800s, collecting animals as provisions and to produce oil, with the last large loads of tortoises from Floreana recorded as occurring between 1831 and 1837 (Townsend 1925, Pritchard 1996). Available population information for Chelonoidis niger indicates that the population was not rare during the 1830s, but had collapsed by about 1850 (Pritchard 1996). Charles Darwin saw no live tortoises when he visited in 1835 and only a handful of tortoises appear to have been collected between 1840 and 1847, with final rapid extinction estimated to have occurred in about 1850 (Broom 1929, Steadman 1986). However, several individuals showing hybridization between  C. niger  and  C. becki have recently been discovered on Wolf Volcano on northern Isabela, as well as some with partial ancestry from other islands, including Española and a few from southern Isabela, and some in captivity at the Galápagos National Park’s Tortoise Center on Santa Cruz Island, probably as a result of C. niger being released on Isabela by whalers or other mariners prior to the 1830s (as with C. abingdonii), suggesting that the taxon’s genome may not yet be fully extirpated (Poulakakis et al. 2008, Russello et al. 2010, Garrick et al. 2012, TEWG 2015). These hybrid individuals exhibit strong genetic signatures of Floreana tortoises, as established by genetic analysis of the type specimen, indicating that their ancestry involves C. niger ancestors possibly only one or two generations back.","Chelonoidis niger occurred on Floreana [formerly Santa María or Charles Island] in the Galápagos Islands of Ecuador. Floreana has a total surface area of 172.5 sq.km, of which ca 81 sq. km (47%) could potentially sustain tortoises (J.P. Gibbs unpubl. data).","This species was exposed to intense exploitation by whalers and other seamen in the 1700s and early 1800s, collecting animals as provisions, with the last large loads of tortoises from Floreana recorded as occurring between 1831 and 1837 (Townsend 1925, Pritchard 1996).",Terrestrial,"Legislation and regulations: Chelonoidis niger is protected under Ecuadorian national law. It has been included in Appendix I of CITES since 1975, prohibiting all forms of commercial international trade. Most of Floreana (98%), and thus the historic range of niger, is protected as part of the Galápagos National Park.Tortoise population restoration on Floreana is currently planned via release of offspring from selectively chosen tortoises with partial Floreana ancestry derived from those identified on Wolf Volcano on Isabela and those in captivity; this complex restoration project was begun in 2015 and will require at least a decade or more for full implementation.

Schwatrz and Carey (1977) suggested that the introduction of goats and/or cats by the lighthouse keepers might have been responsible for its extinction, but Powell (1999) indicated that exploitation by mine workers on the island during the latter half of the 19th century is a more probable explanation.","Surrounded by cliffs, the portions of Navassa Island presumably capable of supporting iguanas prior to their extinction was characterized by Ekman (1929), Proctor (1959), and paraphrased in Powell (1999). The island is a relatively flat shelf of pot-holed, karstic dolomite covered by sparse, shrubby vegetation (largely the result of 19th century mining operations) with a second, higher plateau with apparently natural savannas as well as areas cleared during the mining operations, interspersed with dense but stunted woodland dominated by four tree species: Short Leaf Fig (Ficus populnea var. brevifolia), False Mastic (Sideroxylon foetidissimum), Pigeon Plum (Coccoloba diversifolia), and Poisonwood (Metopium brownei). Although iguanas probably occurred island-wide prior to their extinction, preferred habitat almost certainly consisted of rocky areas and savannas instead of the densely forested portions of the island. Because Navassa lacks beaches, nesting presumably occurred in pockets of mineralized phosphate that accumulated in potholes. The phosphate (which was commercially extracted during the period when the iguanas presumably became extinct) might have been either of marine or terrestrial origin: precipitates of seawater during periods of submergence or from fish digested by birds and deposited as guano, respectively.Among the five specimens known for this iguana, the maximum snout-vent length is 42 cm for the largest male and 37.8 cm snout-vent length for the largest female (Powell 2000). Based on the morphology of similar species, this is probably far less than the maximum for this iguana.","Like other rock iguanas, the Navassa Rhinoceros Iguana was probably threatened by non-native predators, hunting for human consumption, and non-native competitors which destroyed the vegetation. Schwartz and Carey (1977) suggested that the introduction of goats and/or cats by the lighthouse keepers might have been responsible for its extinction, but Powell (1999) indicated that exploitation by mine workers on the island during the latter half of the 19th century was a more probable explanation.",No individuals have been collected or observed since the middle of the 19th century.

Soil erosion and extensive loss of habitat as a result of introduced herbivores have been blamed for the extinction of this snake. Introduced mammalian predators, principally rats, have been identified as the leading cause of historical declines elsewhere in Mauritius and are likely to have resulted in the loss of this species from the main island, likely in the mid-19th century.","Not much is known about this snake's ecology, but its morphology with a blunt snout and no neck suggests it was a sub-fossorial species (Vinson 1953, 1975). A snake suspected of being a burrowing boa was reported to quickly burrow into holes in the ground (Vinson 1953). Bullock (1977) reported that the individual caught in 1975 burrowed through loose soil and plant material with ease.  It is thought that the boa would have lived primarily in the understorey of hardwood and palm-rich forests (Vinson 1953, Bullock 1977). Its specialized jaw morphology is similar to that of the keel-scaled boa (Frazzetta 1970, Cundall and Irish 1986, 1989) and suggests that it predated terrestrial lizards and ground nesting/burrowing seabird chicks, but maybe also lizard and bird eggs. Dissection of a female specimen at the Zoological Museum, Hamburg showed it to contain five eggs (Hallermann and Glaw 2006).An individual collected in 1935 measured 85 cm in length; individuals caught in 1953 and 1967 both measured 95 cm in length (Vinson 1975) and the last individual caught in 1975 was 88 cm in length (Bullock 1977). The five museum specimens measure between 54 and 140 cm (Bauer and Günther 2004). Other specimens have been reported to be up to 180 cm in length (Vinson 1949). The dorsal colouration was light brown with small blackish spots, becoming larger and joining towards the posterior of the body, with vertical streaks on the side of the tail and the ventral colour of the snake was pinkish and marbled and tinged with black (Vinson 1975).","Historically, the bolyerid snakes underwent a rapid decline, because of human visitation and occupation of Mauritius from the 1500s that led to widespread habitat destruction and the introduction of non-native species. Introduced mammalian predators, particularly rats (Arnold 2000, Cheke and Hume 2008) and possibly cats (Felis catus) are thought to have been the main cause of initial declines and loss. Snakes that were encountered on the islands were also shot by early visitors (Cheke 1987, Cheke and Hume 2008). Once restricted to Round Island, introduced goats and rabbits denuded the island of much its vegetation and caused extensive loss of soil, thus removing the burrowing boas’ habitat and their likely reptile prey resources. It is also likely that habitat loss would have led to increased predation of juvenile burrowing boas by the endemic Telfair’s Skink Leiolopisma telfairii.","By 1881, the bolyerid snakes were restricted to Round Island, with rats having invaded Gunner’s Quoin (Rattus norvegicus) and Flat Island (R. rattus) (Cheke and Hume 2008). By the 1900s, the burrowing boa was extremely rare on Round Island with single encounters in 1935, 1953 and 1967, despite repeated searches between the latter two dates (Vinson 1975). The fourth and last individual was detected in August 1975 (Bullock 1977). The removal of goats (Capra aegagrus hircus) in 1979 and rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) in 1986 (Merton 1987), followed by the recovery and restoration of the island’s habitat occurred too late for the burrowing boa: despite extensive searches and a full time presence of conservation staff on Round Island since 2002, the snake has not been detected (Cole et al. 2018) and is considered to be extinct.","The Round Island Burrowing Boa was a Mauritian endemic known from Round Island (2.19 km2). The burrowing boa was thought to have occurred on mainland Mauritius, but it is uncertain whether sub-fossil vertebrae belong to this burrowing boa or the extant Keel-scaled Boa Casarea dussumieri (Arnold 1980). If the former, the species is likely to have become locally extinct on this island in the mid-1800s due to the invasion of introduced mammalian predators, particularly rats (Rattus norvegicus and R. rattus). Snakes of the size of the Round Island Burrowing Boa and Keel-scaled Boa were recorded on the offshore islets Gunner’s Quoin (0.70 km2) and Flat Island (2.53 km2) in the north until at least 1839 and Ile de la Passe (0.02 km2) in the southeast in the 1760s (Cheke 1987, Cheke and Hume 2008). Whilst the Keel-scaled Boa was certainly present on these islands, we can only presume that the Round Island Burrowing Boa also existed on at least Flat Island and Gunner’s Quoin.","There is no known use of or trade in this species, which is presumed to be extinct.",Terrestrial,"No conservation measures are possible for this species, which is extinct, although Round Island is a strict nature reserve where restoration of natural habitat is ongoing.

The 2014 assessment is observing the five year rule set out in section 2.2.1 of the Guidelines for Using the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria, which requires a species to remain in its original category for a time period of five years from the time it no longer meets the criteria for that category (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2014). As reintroductions began in 2013, the species will require reassessment in 2018. This five-year time period will allow for monitoring of the species' recovery and the viability of its re-introduced population.","This species lived only in soaked herbaceous vegetation in the spray zone of the Kihansi Falls. An artificial gravity-fed sprinkler system is currently in place to mimic the original conditions of the spray zone. The toad breeds by internal fertilization, with females retaining the larvae internally in the oviduct until little toadlets are born. Clutch size varies from 5–13 offspring (Channing et al. 2006).","The serious decline and extinction of this species appears tp be related to the Lower Kihansi Hydropower Project, which involved the construction of a dam upstream on the Kihansi River in 2000. The dam cut off 90% of the original water flow to the gorge, thereby hugely reducing the volume of spray, particularly in the dry season, as well as altering the vegetational composition. An artificial gravity-fed sprinkler system was set up to mimic the natural spray of the Kihansi ecosystem with the remaining water flow. Unfortunately, the sprinkler system was not ready by the time the water was cut off in 2000, and by the time the sprinklers came on nine months later the ecosystem had already dried up (see Krajick 2006). Later, during the dry season in 2003, the artificial sprinkler system failed for a while. Around this time, the fungal disease chytridiomycosis was confirmed in dead animals of this species, and this disease is probably responsible for the final population crash. It is possible that the drought caused by the failure of the sprinkler system resulted in stress to the animals that rendered them susceptible to the disease. There are also reports that the 2003 crash coincided with a brief opening of the dam's floodgates to flush sediments; tests showed that these contained pesticides used in maize farming operations upstream, in concentrations sufficient to kill the toads (Krajick 2006). The impact of predation by safari ants (Dorylus sp.) and crabs (Potomonautes sp.) is unknown (Channing et al. 2006).","Formerly it was abundant in a tiny area, with a population of around 17,000 individuals. Reports indicate that the species fluctuated naturally in its population size. The population appeared to be at a high in May 1999, dropping to lower numbers in the course of 2001 and 2002 [total population estimates oscillated at around 11,000 individuals up until March 2002; see Channing et al. 2006], and at a high again in June 2003 [a total population estimate of 20,989 individuals; Channing et al. 2006]. However, subsequently the population went into steep decline, and by mid-January 2004, only three individuals could be seen and just two males were heard calling. There were a few records of calling animals during the rest of 2004, and an unconfirmed report from May 2005 (CBSG 2007), but there were no records of any individuals in subsequent years, despite surveys, leading to the species being listed as Extinct in the Wild in May 2009.In an effort to re-introduce the species into the wild, Toledo and Bronx Zoos have been conducting an ex situ breeding programme. In June 2012 1,000 toads were involved in release experiments (where some were retained in a captive facility at Kihansi and a few were sent to the gorge). In October 2012 2,000 toads were re-introduced back to the gorge. In October 2013 2,000 toads were involved in several activities (where some were kept at Kihansi captive breeding facility, some were used for release experiments and some were re-introduced back to the gorge). There is a plan to re-introduce another 2,000 toads to the wild probably in October 2014 (W. Ngalason  pers. comm. July 2014).","This species was a micro-endemic of the Kihansi Falls, in the Kihansi Gorge, in the Udzungwa Mountains, eastern Tanzania, at 600-940 m asl. Its global range covered an area of less than two hectares around the Kihansi Falls, and searches for it around other waterfalls on the escarpment of the Udzungwa Mountains have not located any additional populations (Channing et al. 2006).","In 2000, at the invitation of the Tanzanian government, the Bronx Zoo collected 499 individuals to establish an ex-situ breeding programme in view of creating an assurance population.",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"This toad is not known from any protected areas.

Its closest sister species, Gongylomorphus bojerii from Mauritius, is diurnal and inhabits most habitats on the island (Cole et al. 2009), including lowland forest, grassland, sparsely vegetated areas with creepers as ground cover, and bare rock with crevices and rock piles (M. Sanchez pers. comm. 2020). The Réunion species was probably found in dry forest in the west of the island and in coastal vegetation (Probst 1998). It was probably primarily insectivorous in common with its extant relatives (Probst 1998)","This species is extinct, and the most likely cause of its extinction is the introduction of the Southeast Asian Wolf Snake (Lycodon capucinus), a specialist feeder on lizards, to Réunion in the mid-19th century (Austin et al. 2009). The documented timing of this snake's establishment on both Réunion (by 1840, based on testimony taken in 1839 - Cheke 1987) and mainland Mauritius (before 1873 - Daruty de Grandpré 1883) coincides with the extinction of Gongylomorphus skinks on both islands. Musk Shews (Suncus murinus), have been observed preying on Mauritian Gongylomorphus (Cole 2011), and this invasive species probably contributed to the historical decline (M. Sanchez pers. comm. 2020). Gongylomorphus fontenayi survives on the Mauritian mainland only in an area where Wolf Snake and shrew densities are low (Jones 1993, Cheke and Hume 2998).","This species is reported as having once been abundant in some areas of Réunion, from which it was last reported in 1839 (Austin et al. 2009).

Historical accounts describe how they could rapidly change colour from the vibrant green to black (Vinson and Vinson 1969). The geckos were reported to measure 20 to 27 cm in total length (Vinson and Vinson 1969), with museum specimens ranging in size from 155 to 207 mm in total length, with snout to vent lengths of 85 to 108 mm (Vinson and Vinson 1969, Bour et al. 2014). The tooth morphology suggests that the species was primarily frugivorous (N. Arnold pers. obs. in Austin et al. 2014). Historical accounts state that they consumed the fruit of palm trees, flies and other insects and had a liking for palms, but would venture into buildings, onto roofs and were very tame (Vinson and Vinson 1969, Austin et al. 2014, Cheke and Hume 2008). Natural predators that were recorded by early visitors to Rodrigues consisted of the now extinct Rodrigues Night Heron (Nycticorax megacephalus) and Rodrigues Owl (Mascarenotus murivorus) (Vinson and Vinson 1969, Cheke and Hume 2008).","This gecko species is likely to have become extinct as a result of predation by introduced rats that were present on the main island by the late 1600s, and possibly cats introduced between 1725 and 1761 to control rat populations (Vinson and Vinson 1969, Cheke and Hume 2008). By the late 1800s, when the geckos were scarce or had already possibly become restricted to the islets, much of the forests had gone (Cheke and Hume 2008). It is therefore likely that habitat loss was a contributory factor, although when recorded in abundance on Ile aux Foux in the late 1700s, there was virtually no vegetation and the geckos would take refuge in rock crevices (Vinson and Vinson 1969).","This species is extinct. Only seven preserved specimens are known, six of which are in museums (Bour et al. 2014), in addition to numerous sub-fossil bones from approximately 100 individuals (Austin et al. 2004). The species survived for longer than other endemic lizards on Rodrigues, none of which are extant. Until 1795, it was still abundant on the main island and was probably found on several of the 21 offshore islets, but the only islet from which it was confirmed as being present is Ile aux Fous (0.33 ha), where it was recorded in great numbers by Pingré in 1761 (Vinson and Vinson 1969, Bour et al. 2014). In the late 1700s, Philibert Marragon observed that fewer geckos were encountered in winter compared to summer (Vinson and Vinson 1969). In 1874, they could not be found on the mainland and two specimens collected in 1884 were thought to have been from one of the islets (Vinson and Vinson 1969). The last two geckos - collected by Etienne Thirioux in 1917 - were also thought to have been from an islet (Vinson and Vinson 1969). Targeted surveys for a surviving populations on the mainland and islets were undertaken in the 1960s and again in 2013 without success (Vinson and Vinson 1969, Cole et al. 2013, Jean-Baptiste 2013).","This species was known only from Rodrigues, a remote, autonomous island within the territory of Mauritius, and at least one of its offshore islets.","There is no use of or trade in this species, which is extinct.",Terrestrial,"No conservation measures are possible for this species, which is extinct.

When, in the late 1600s, Etienne de Flacourt interviewed local Malagasy people in the region of Tolagnaro (Fort Dauphin), southeastern Madagascar, he found that his informants believed this to be still alive. Locally known as the “tretretretre”, the animal was said to have a short, round head, human-like face and ears, monkey-like hands and feet with elongated digits, frizzy hair, and a short tail. Folklorists recorded stories of an “ogre” with peculiar sloth-like behavioural characteristics into the late 1800s.","Palaeopropithecus was morphologically strongly convergent on extant arboreal sloths, hence the name ""sloth lemur.""  It lived in a wide variety of forested habitats, and while its postcranial adaptations reveal tree-slothlike (highly suspensory, arboreal) behaviour, it is also known to have descended to the ground, where it sometimes fell victim to crocodiles.  The Family to which it belongs (i.e., the Palaeopropithecidae) is closely related to the Family Indriidae.  However, unlike living indriids, Palaeopropithecus was not able to leap, and would have moved in a four-footed suspensory manner in trees, and in a sprawling manner on the ground, grabbing onto ground vegetation and slowly moving forward, as do tree sloths when they descend to the ground.  It is believed to have been highly folivorous.Palaeopropithecus ingens lived in the subarid forests of southern and southwestern Madagascar (spiny thicket and succulent woodland).  P. maximus lived in the sub-humid forests of the central highlands and in the dry deciduous forests of the extreme north.  P. kelyus is known from the lowland western dry forests in the Mahajanga region (northwest) and at the Beanka reserve just north of the tsingy of Bemaraha (near the west coast).","The reasons for the extinction are not known, although multiple hypotheses have been proposed.

It was endemic to New Zealand, where it was widely distributed in lowland rivers and streams throughout the North and South Islands. It was abundant at the time of European settlement in the 1860s, but population decline was noted by the late 1870s. The species' disappearance continued rapidly and, by the 1920s the species was known to exist only in some streams in the east Cape, Wairarapa and Otaki districts in the North Island, and on the West Coast of the South Island. Even in these areas, it had undergone significant rapid decline and specimens were rarely encountered. In the early 1930s a specimen, possibly the last, was brought to the British Museum, however, the origin and date of collection were not noted. The New Zealand Grayling was an amphidromous species, which migrated up rivers in large shoals in late summer, spent the autumn and early winter up-stream (perhaps spawning), then disappeared again in early spring, presumably returning to the sea. It was an important fishery species to New Zealand's indigenous Maori and vast numbers were caught using a variety of techniques including net, weir traps and drive fishing. The roe of this species was also consumed. The demise of the New Zealand Grayling was possibly due to a combination of factors including over-exploitation by early settlers, the deterioration of the freshwater habitat through the clearance of forest cover resulting in increased light penetration and raised water temperature and the impact of invasive salmonids. Although it is unlikely that any targeted surveys to look for this species have occurred in the last couple of decades, drift diving (a widely conducted method to survey for trout) in clear lowland rivers (prime Grayling habitat) would be an ideal way to record this species, but there have been no sightings.","The New Zealand Grayling was an amphidromous species, inhabiting freshwater, brackish and marine environments, including rivers, streams, at the mouths of tributary streams and in quiet backwaters. Formerly, they migrated up rivers in large shoals in late summer, spent the autumn and early winter up-stream (perhaps spawning), then disappeared again in early spring, presumably returning to the sea. Spawning apparently occurred in freshwater streams and hatched larvae made their way downstream to the sea where they remained until maturity and returned to freshwater spawning areas (Baillie and Groombridge 1996, Radway-Allen 1949).","The extinction of this species was possibly due to a combination of factors including over-exploitation by early settlers, the deterioration of the freshwater habitat through the clearance of forest cover resulting in increased light penetration and raised water temperature and the impact of invasive salmonids (Baillie and Groombridge 1996, McDowall 2010).","This species was abundant at the time of European settlement in the 1860s, but population decline was noted by the late 1870s. Hector (1871) reported of immense and conspicuous shoals ascending the Hutt River (southern North Island) in January. Apparently, however, signs of decreasing numbers were evident soon afterwards. The disappearance of the fish from the Waikato River (North Island) was noted to have occurred in 1874. In 1878, Rutland (who studied the species in the Nelson and Marlborough district, South Island), noted that in the Maitai River (n the north of the South Island) it had 'become very scarce during the past three years'.

The captive population in China has increased in recent years, and the possibility remains that free-ranging populations can be established some time in the near future. When that happens, its Red List status will need to be reassessed.","Studies have been carried out on the behaviour, ecology and reproduction of Père David’s Deer in Beijing since 1985, in Dafeng since 1986, and in Shishou since 2001. This species lives in low-lying grasslands and reed beds, often in seasonally flooded areas such as the lower Yangtze River valley and coastal marshes. It eats grass, reeds and leaves of bushes, can swim well, and spend long periods in water. It lives in single sex ormaternal herds. Animals reach maturity during second year. Gestation is 270-300 days. One, rarely two young are born. These are weaned in 10-11 months. Adults live up to 18 years. Data from the Dafeng Reserve suggests that female E. davidianus establish a home range of approximately 1 km² (Hu and Jiang 2002).","The species became extinct in the wild due to habitat loss and hunting. The size of the reintroduced population was only 120 in 1993 (Cao 1993), although has increased to over 2,000 since that time (Yang et al. 2008). Low genetic diversity has been identified as a long-term threat by Zeng et al. (2007) and Yang et al. (2008). It is unclear how much native habitat remains on which E. davidianus can exist in a free-ranging state.","After decades of ex situ conservation, the species breeds successfully in captivity (Beck and Wemmer 1983). In China there are now fenced populations in Beijing, Dafeng, Shishou and Yuanyang. The first conservation reintroduction of Père David’s Deer to China included two groups, of 20 deer (5 males : 15 females) and 18 deer (all females), in 1985 and 1987, respectively. All 38 deer were donated by the Marquess of Tavistock of Woburn Abbey (later the 14th Duke of Bedford), who also covered transportation costs of the first group. After a careful search and evaluation by a group of zoologists, botanists, wildlife managers and officers, the relic site of the Nanyuang Royal Hunting Garden in the southern suburbs of Beijing was chosen as the site of re-introduction, creating the Beijing Milu Park (39°07'N, 116°03'E), with an area of 60 ha. The deer in the park have received supplemental feeding year round (Jiang et al. 2000a).The second re-introduction of E. davidianus was carried out in August of 1987, organized by former Ministry of Forestry and funded by WWF. A group of 39 Père David’s Deer was selected from five zoological gardens in the United Kingdom, with the deer mainly from the Whipsnade Wild Animal Park. An extensive search, which covered a vast area in eastern China for a potential reintroduction site was conducted before a decision was made. The Dafeng State-Owen Forestry Farm was chosen, on the Yellow Sea coast in eastern China in a lightly populated area (semi-fossils of Père David’s Deer have been excavated from the neighbouring counties, so this site is probably in its natural habitat). The introduced herd was released into three fenced paddocks, each about 100 ha in area. The reserve purchased another 30 km² land in 1995, more than doubling its original size. In 1997, the Dafeng Milu Natural Reserve was approved by the National Nature Reserve Commission as a national nature reserve. The Dafeng Milu Nature Reserve has the potential to host a large population of Père David’s Deer. The reserve has kept the reintroduced Père David’s Deer and their offspring on its land, and in 1998 the first group of deer was released from the paddocks into the wider reserve (Hu and Jiang 2002). In 2003, and 2006 another two groups of deer were released from the paddocks. There were 950 Père David’s Deer in the reserve in 2006. The annual average population growth rate of deer in the reserve was 17.01%. This Père David’s Deer conservation strategy calls for further expanding of the DafengMilu Nature Reserve (Jiang et al. 2000b). The Beijing Milu Park is in the southeast suburb of Beijing with a limited area and is now part of a much larger ‘Wetland Park’ being established (2012-2016), whereas the DafengMilu Nature Reserve is located in a remote coastal region with little human settlement, where it is possible to acquire more land for conservation. Therefore, the Beijing Milu Park while keeping a healthy nuclear breeding herd of about 200 deer at the park, is shipping Père David’s Deer to other sites in east China (Yang 2007) and in Hebei Province. The translocations thus reduced the grazing pressure on the park vegetation and expanded the distribution range of the Père David’s Deer in the country. The average annual population growth rate for Père David’s Deer in Beijing Milu Park from 1987-1997 was 17.3%. This Père David’s Deer conservation strategy calls for an expansion of this artificial dispersal of animals to establish new sites (Jiang et al. 2000b). E. davidianus from the Beijing Milu Park have been relocated to the lower reaches of the Yangtze River in eastern China and Hainan Island in the South China Sea. In October 1993, a group of 30 Père David’s Deer (8 males : 22 females) arrived and was released in a paddock on a small peninsular along the Yangtze River, Shishou (29°49'N,112°33'E). This site was later established as the Hubei Shishou Milu National Nature Reserve. The size of the reserve is 11.67 km². Another group of 34 Père David’s Deer (10 males : 24 females) was transferred from the Beijing Milu Park to the Shishou paddock in the following year to enlarge the population. An additional 30 deer (15 males : 15 females) were released into the paddock of the reserve in 2002. The relocated deer reproduced in the second year after the relocation (Yang et al. 2002). By the end of calving season of 2006, there were 522 E. davidianus in the Shishou Milu National Nature Reserve. The annual average population growth rate was 22.2%. The birth rate and population growth rate in Shishou were significantly higher whereas the mortality rate was significantly lower than those of the Dafeng Nature Reserve. In November, 2002, 30 E. davidianus (14 males : 16 females) from Beijing Milu Park and 20 from the DafengMilu Nature Reserve were introduced to Yuanyang Forestry Farm, Henan. These deer are in an enclosure on the Yuanyang Yellow River Nature Reserve (35°11'N, 114°15'E). In 2006, there were 53 deer in the Yuanyang Yellow River Nature Reserve paddock, but the sex ratio was predominately male biased (38 males : 15 females) (Li et al. 2007). Currently, there are a total of 53 herds of E. davidianus in China. Nine herds have fewer than 25 deer, 75.5% have fewer than 10 deer (Yang et al. 2003). Such a small herd size raise question about the effective population size and health of population genetics, since those herds are isolated and there is no gene exchange. The artificially dispersed E. davidianus herds are similar to a meta-population. The viability of the meta-population depends on the man-made gene exchange process by the managers. There are now four wild populations (not fenced) living in Hubei and Hunan provinces established by escaped individuals from Shishou Nature Reserve during severe flooding in 1998. The latest data from 2015 suggests that the wild population is about 600 individuals (M. Boyd pers. comm. 2015), surveys need to be conducted to assess the long-term viability of these populations.","This species is endemic to China. Père David’s Deer has been recovered from the brink of extinction and has become a classic example of how to rescue a highly threatened species (Ebenehard 1995). In the mid 1980s, Père David’s Deer was re-introduced into captive facilities in China, and populations established first in Beijing and then in Dafeng, Shishou and Yuanyang. Fossils of Elaphurus bifurcatus, E. chinanensis chia, E. lantianensis have been excavated from the region east of Xi’an and south of Harbin. The modern species of Elaphurus, Père David’s Deer (Milu in Chinese) evolved in the Pliocene period of the Tertiary, according to fossils excavated in southern Japan. During the Pleistocene period, it was known from Manchuria (Hofmann 2007). During the Holocene, P. davidianus was restricted to swamps and wetlands in the region south of 43°N and east of 110°E in mainland China (Cao 1993, Zhou 2007). However, the distribution of P. davidianus shrank and its population declined due to hunting and land reclamation in the swamp areas as human population expanded (Jiang and Li 1999). P. davidianus is believed to have been largely extinct in the wild 1500 years before the last head was decimated by the late 19th century during the Boxer Rebellion in Beijing.During the Qing Dynasty (1616-1911), the Nanyuang Royal Hunting Garden contained a herd of P. davidianus in its 200 km² hunting ground. This hunting garden in the southern suburbs of Beijing was predominantly a wetland, consisting of swamps, ponds and lakes crossed by the Yongding River. The area had been sealed off from the outside world since the Yuan Dynasty (1205-1368) as a royal garden. The French missionary Père Armand David “discovered” P. davidianus in the Nanyuan Royal Hunting Garden in 1864. Realizing that the deer was an unknown species to the West, he persuaded the wardens to give him hinds and skeletons of an adult male, an adult female and a young male, and sent them to Paris in 1866, where the species was named Père David’s deer by Milne-Edwards. In 1895, the surrounding wall of the Nanyuan Hunting Garden was destroyed by a heavy flood of the Yongding River, and most of the Père David’s Deer escaped and were hunted. Only 20-30 animals survived in the garden. Then in 1900, during the Boxer Rebellion, the garden was occupied by troops and the remaining deer were shot and eaten.However, before the demise of the royal herd of Père David’s Deer in the Nanyuan Royal Hunting Garden in 1900, the deer had been introduced into private deer collections in the United Kingdom, Belgium, France and Germany. During the first decade of the 20th century, the 11th Duke of Bedford in the United Kingdom gathered the last 18 Père David’s Deer in the world to form a breeding herd at the Woburn Abbey Estate, England. Only 11 of these deer were capable of reproducing (Bedford, 1951-52). Nevertheless, the heavily inbred Père David’s Deer safely passed though the genetic bottleneck of inbreeding and adopted the vast open parkland of an English country estate (Jones et al. 1983).The captive population started to increase (though with a setback during the First World War due to food shortage), and since the Second World War, the animals started to be spread through captive facilities worldwide, with the first captive animals being sent back to Beijing Zoo in 1956.",,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"It is listed on the Chinese Red List as Extinct in the Wild, and on the China Key List - I.

Conduct surveys of the four free-living sub-populations in Hubei and Hunan provinces to assess their long-term viability.3. Establish a genetic management programme of all populations in China. 4. Develop conservation education programmes to raise conservation awareness among the local people and general public.Following a trial release of this species in the Dafeng Reserve, China, Hu and Jiang (2002) concluded that future releases will necessitate either natural or artificial boundaries to alleviate conflict between introduced E. davidianus and farmers, on whose land the deer are likely to stray. These authors suggest a reintroduction model based on that of Oryx leucoryx in Oman (Stanley Price 1989).",Palearctic,Global

It was last seen in 1990, and exhaustive surveys at the species' known sites and the only other adjacent site with suitable habitat at suitable elevations have failed to record the species in several decades. The species experienced drastic population declines, probably due to chytridiomycosis and habitat loss, and has apparently not recuperated.","This species lived on the ground along mountain streams in premontane and lower montane moist forest. It presumably bred by direct development, with eggs laid on land, similar to other species in the Craugastor rugulosus series (McCranie and Castaneda 2007). It was not though to have tolerated habitat disturbance.","Species of the Craugastor rugulosus group appear to have undergone dramatic declines between mid 1980s to early 1990s across Honduras, including within undisturbed habitat which is a strong indicator of chytrid-related declines (Honduras Red List Assessment Workshop March 2019). Chytridiomycosis is thought to have contributed to the extinction of this species (J. Townsend, L. Herrera and J. Kolby pers. comm. March 2019), as well as habitat loss and degradation caused by agricultural encroachment, wood extraction, forest fires, water pollution, and landslides. The type locality of this species was already within a disturbed area of human settlement (J. Townsend pers. comm. March 2019). The second locality, Rio Arcaqual, is affected at lower elevations by a small dam that is undergoing increased use pressure by local communities; and if the species was still present, then it is thought that this would be a threat to it (L. Herrera, J. Townsend and H. Vega pers. comm. March 2019).Highland amphibians are adapted to inhabit a narrow climatic envelope. Changes in climate are expected to reduce the available suitable habitat and required microclimates. Rapid shifts in the climatic conditions required by these species would not allow sufficient opportunity for adaptation, especially in light of the limited possibility for elevational migration. Tropical Montane Cloud Forest (&gt;1,000 m asl) has been demonstrated to be negatively affected by climatic changes to a greater extent than other habitats (Foden et al. 2013, Wicaksono et al. 2017, Lyra et al. 2017, Neate-Clegg et al. 2018). An increase in high rainfall events is being observed throughout its range, as well as an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events (hurricanes and droughts) in the Caribbean, destroying the riparian habitat required by stream-dwelling and stream-associated amphibian species (Honduras Amphibian Red List Workshop March 2019). Climate change is therefore considered to be both a current and future threat to all amphibian species in this habitat type. Furthermore, amphibians globally are at an increased risk of disease (e.g. chytridiomycosis) and a decline in fecundity due to such changes (Pounds et al. 2006, Blaustein et al. 2010).","It had always been extremely rare, and is now considered to be extinct. Surveys were conducted for this species in 1995 and 1997, and no individuals were found (McCranie and Castaneda 2007). A two-night survey was conducted in 2008 at the type locality and did not record this species, and a 12 day survey (involving nine people for three days, and five people for the remaining six days) was conducted in 2015 that specifically looked for the two endemic amphibians on this mountain within suitable elevation range (including areas not previously surveyed for amphibians), and did not find the species (J.

Fishing effort and intensity has also increased in the past; for example, in the Neijiang reach of the Tuo River there were only 500 fishing boats in the1950s, but this increased to approximately 2,000 by 1985. In the Leshan Reach of the Ming River, drift gill nets are crowded together from day to night. The primary traditional fishing season in the main stream of the Yangzte River was between March and August, with more than 30% of the catch processed between April and May. This is also the spawning season for Acipenser dabryanus, therefore spawning stocks were particularly vulnerable to capture. The construction of the Gezhouba Dam in 1981 and the Three Gorges Dam in 2003 have also caused major adverse effects to the habitat of this species and, prior to the wild population disappearing, these constructions caused the population to be restricted to the upstream river, above the dams. The construction of the Xiangjiaba Dam in 2008 is situated in the middle of this sturgeon's spawning reach and is therefore expected to adversely affect it through habitat fragmentation and associated habitat degradation. More recently, two more dams were constructed upriver, changing the temperature and hydrology of the river. Additionally, pollution from human development affects the entire Yangtze basin. Much untreated waste water discharges into the river each year. Water quality is also affected by run-off caused by deforestation of the upper Yangtze Valley (Zhuang et al. 1997). Pollution has been declining regionally in recent years.","There seems to be no natural reproduction of this species any more, and there are no mature individuals of wild origin due to heavy overfishing. Historically, this was an important species in commercial fisheries of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River (Chen 2007). In the late 20th century, population numbers declined drastically due to overfishing and habitat degradation. Catch data between 1982 and 2019 indicate that since 2008, hundreds of individuals are being captured annually, all originating from releases (Wei 2019, pers. comm.). The species is now fully ranched, and no natural reproduction or natural population is documented in the wild. Artificial propagation began in 1976 by the Chongqing Fisheries Institute, China (Wei 2019, pers. comm.). From 2007 to 2018, approximately 200,000 juveniles were released into the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River for stock rehabilitation, which has not yet been proven successful. Since 2018, mature individuals have also been stocked. This, and the imminent total ban of fishing, will hopefully improve the chances of this species recovering in the future.","This species is endemic to China, where it is restricted to the Yangtze River system. Historically, under the natural, unaltered conditions that existed until the middle of the 20th century, this species inhabited the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River and its large tributaries, including the Ming, Tuo, Jialing, Xiang and Han rivers, as well as the large lakes attached to the Yangtze River. Acipenser dabryanus had been extirpated from the lower river, possibly since 1995, and it was restricted to the upper main stream of the Yangtze River in the Sichuan Province (Zhuang et al. 1997). Starting in 2007, the conservation release programme was carried out in the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River. Currently, this fish can be found in the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River, as well as in the confluences with some tributaries. However, the majority of individuals observed in the river originate from large scale releases and reproduction of the species in the wild has not been confirmed for at least two decades (one generation length for this species is 30 years).","Acipenser dabryanus was caught intensively for human consumption until the year 2000. Since 2000, sturgeons are only taken accidentally as bycatch and were mostly released, however post-release survival was low. Since 2021, a full ban of fishing (for all fish species) in the Yangtze River main stem is in place to protect the endemic fish fauna. There is a large production of this species in aquaculture for restocking and conservation purposes.",Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Fishing will be banned completely by 2021 in the main stem of the Yangtze River. In 2000, the first national nature reserve was created in the upper Yangzte River. The area of this reserve was extended in 2005 to mitigate the conflict between hydroelectric projects and maintenance of ecosystem functionality. The reserve is now the largest aquatic reserve in China, which has a total length of 1,162.6 km, including 436.5 km of the main river (Zhang et al. 2009). Acipenser dabryanus has been listed as a First Class Protected Animal of the State since 1988, and has received the same effective protection as the Chinese Sturgeon (Acipenser sinensis). This species was also listed on CITES Appendix II in 1998. There is also a national action plan for the species. It is considered that the survival of Yangtze Sturgeon entirely relies on stocking efforts, without which this species would possibly become extinct (Zhang et al. 2009). Artificial propagation was first carried out in 1976. The second and third generation propagation were carried out successfully by the Yangtze River Fisheries Research Institute in 2013 and 2018, respectively. From 2007 to 2018, approximately 200,000 juveniles were released into the upper Yangtze River for stock rehabilitation. In 2018, around 40 mature individuals were released into the same waters. To date, there has been no evidence that the species currently is reproducing in the wild, but the fishing ban, ongoing stocking and the national action plan are likely to rebuild a self-sustaining population within the next few decades.",Palearctic,Global

This species experienced a very rapid decline, from being common to extinct in less than a year, most likely due to chytridiomycosis.","This was a mostly aquatic species largely restricted to the shallow section of fast-flowing creeks and streams in rainforest. It was only recorded from pristine rainforest where there was no disturbance. Males would call in summer along the edge of creeks and streams. It was one of only two known species to brood its offspring within its stomach. Females deposited their eggs, and then swallowed them. While in the stomach, tadpoles excreted some form of enzyme that inhibited the female's gastric digestion, and then proceeded to develop into fully formed froglets. The froglets were then regurgitated through the female's mouth.","The cause(s) of the population decline remain unknown. McDonald (1990) found no obvious evidence that seasonal rarity, over-collecting, predation, drought, floods, habitat destruction, disease, heavy parasite loads or stress due to handling for data collection were responsible for the population declines. Threats to the Eungella National Park include fires that might sweep up the slopes of the mountain during harvesting of the sugar cane in the fields below (Winter and McDonald 1986). Successive fires extend deeper into the rainforest leaving grassy ridges that are devoid of trees (Winter and McDonald 1986). The rainforest is extremely narrow in places and continual fire might eventually erode away entire sections of the forest or fragment the forest (Winter and McDonald 1986). Weeds that encroach on the edges of the forest pose a similar threat (Winter and McDonald 1986). It was thought that it might have been possible that the decline that was observed in 1984–1985 was a natural population fluctuation and that residual individuals had retreated to hidden refuges (Winter and McDonald 1986; McDonald 1990). The extent of such population fluctuations is unknown, but there is evidence of large swings in numbers of other Australian frogs (McDonald 1990). However, despite continued efforts to locate the species, it has not been recorded within Eungella National Park or any other locations since March 1985 (Ingram and McDonald 1993; Richards, McDonald and Alford 1993; Hero et al. 1998, 2002; McDonald and Alford 1999). Eungella National Park is subject to weed invasion on the edges of the reserve (Winter and McDonald 1986). From what is known from similar declines and disappearance elsewhere in the world, chytridiomycosis (present in at least some rainforest streams at Eungella) must be suspected as the most likely cause of the extinction of this species. The Eungella Torrent Frog (Taudactylus eugellensis), which inhabited the same streams, was actively preyed upon by Rhobatrachus vitellinus (Winter and McDonald 1986) and suffered a steep population decline around the same time as R. vitellinus was discovered to have traces of infection from the chytrid fungus (McDonald 1990, Rettalick et al. 2004). Taudactylus eugellensis has been implicated as a host and reservoir for the chytrid fungus (Rettalick et al. 2004) so it is therefore very likely that transmission of the fungus occurred between these species.","The species was considered common across its range until January 1985 when the first signs of decline (reported by Winter and McDonald 1986) were observed at lower altitudes (about 400 m asl) (McDonald 1990). At higher altitudes the frogs remained common until March 1985, but were absent in June of that year (McDonald 1990). Despite continued efforts to locate the species, it has not been recorded again within Eungella National Park or any other locations (Ingram and McDonald 1993, McDonald and Alford 1999, Meyer et al. 2020). Most recently, between 2000–2015 surveys targeting this species and other endemics in the region at 114 sites within Eungella National Park and adjoining State Forest found no trace of the species. This species is considered to be extinct.","This Australian endemic species was discovered in January 1984 (Mahony et al. 1984) and was found exclusively in undisturbed rainforest in Eungella National Park, mid-eastern Queensland at altitudes of 400–1,000 m asl (Covacevich and McDonald 1993).

This species experienced a very rapid decline in the wild, from being common to extinct in just a few years, most likely due to chytridiomycosis. Extensive searches in the following 25 years failed to locate this species. There are fewer targeted searches for this species now that considerable time has passed since an individual was last seen in the wild.","This species lived in rainforest, wet sclerophyll forest and riverine gallery open forest at 350 m asl and was closely associated with watercourses and adjacent rock pools and soaks (Czechura 1991, Meyer et al. 2001). These streams are mostly perennial, but in extremely dry years they may cease to flow (Ingram 1983). The vegetation along the stream banks is usually closed forest or tall closed forest with emergent eucalypts, although there are some sites in open forest with grassy ground cover (Ingram 1983). In spring and summer individuals were usually found in or at the edge of rock pools, either amongst leaf-litter, under and between stones or in crevices around the edge (Ingram 1983). The species was also found under rock in shallow water in backwaters and also the main flow of permanent watercourses (Ingram 1983, Czechura 1991). Searches of popular sites in winter only recovered two frogs and it is assumed that the species hibernated in deep crevices in rocks or spaces between rocks underwater during the colder months (Ingram 1983). Adult males tended to prefer deeper pools, whereas females and juveniles may have moved to newly created pools after rain as long as these pools contained stones and/or leaf-litter (Ingram 1983). The prerequisite for the use of pools by this species seemed to be that the pool must be deep enough for the frog to be able to sit with its head out of the water and be able to safely submerge (Ingram 1983). Individuals would only sit fully exposed on the rocks during light rain (Ingram 1983). The species was never recorded from cleared riparian habitat.Breeding activity occurred between October and December (Ingram 1983). Males called from rock crevices above pools (Ingram 1983). Females brood young within their stomach and gave birth through the mouth (Tyler and Carter 1982). Fertilized eggs or early stage larvae were presumably swallowed by the female and completed their development in the stomach (Tyler and Carter 1982). The number of eggs in gravid females (approximately 40) exceeded the number of juveniles found to occur in the stomach (21–26) (Tyler 1989). It is not known whether or not the excess eggs were digested by the female or whether or not they were simply not swallowed (Tyler 1989). The production of hydrochloric acid in the stomach of the female ceased during brooding (Tyler et al. 1983). Tadpoles developed in a manner similar to the aquatic tadpoles of other species though, as they fed off egg yolk, the labial teeth were absent and the intestines formed at a later stage of development (Tyler 1989). After 6–7 weeks the females gave birth to up to 25 young (Tyler and Davies 1983a). Young emerged from the female’s mouth as fully formed frogs and after four days the digestive tract returned to normal and the female recommenced feeding (Tyler and Davies 1983b). Ingram (1983) reported minimum brooding periods from two individuals of 36 and 43 days and suggested that the duration was such that females were unlikely to breed twice in one season.","The reason(s) for the disappearance of this species remains unknown (Tyler and Davies 1985). Populations were present in logged catchments between 1972 and 1979. Although the species persisted in the streams during these activities, the effects of timber harvesting on this aquatic species were never investigated. Its habitat is currently threatened by feral pigs, invasion of weeds (especially Mistflower Ageratina riparia), and altered flow and water quality due to upstream disturbances (Hines et al. 1999). However, from what is known from similar declines and disappearances elsewhere in the world, the disease chytridiomycosis must be suspected.","When first discovered, this species was extremely abundant and common. The species declined rapidly and disappeared at about the same time as a sympatric species Taudactylus diurnus (Czechura and Ingram 1990). Czechura and Ingram (1990) and Ingram (1990) state that the last frog was seen in the wild in 1979 on the Conondale Range. However, Richards et al. (1993) reported the existence of a specimen taken from the Blackall Range in September 1981. Despite intensive searching, the species has not been located since (Ingram and McDonald 1993, Hines et al. 1999). In the laboratory, the last known individual died in November 1983 (Tyler and Davies 1985b). Ingram (1983) studied a population of the species in the headwaters of Booloumba Creek, Conondale Range, and estimated that approximately 78 were present in 1976. No other estimates of population size are available for the species. This species is believed to be extinct.","This Australian endemic species was restricted to elevations between 350 and 800 m asl in the Blackall and Conondale Ranges in southeast Queensland (Hines et al. 1999) with a geographic distribution of less than 1,400 km2 (map in Hines et al. 1999).

It was usually found perched on rocks or overhanging vegetation adjacent to the water (Liem 1974). Little is known about the life history of this species. Mating calls were heard from October to March (Liem 1974). From 86–90 large unpigmented eggs (1.9–2.5mm diameter) were laid under rocks in riffles (Richards 1993, Hero and Fickling 1996). Richards (1992) described the tadpole and noted that it was one of the few species of tadpole known to exhibit adaptations to torrent environments of Australia, including a streamlined body shape, large suctorial mouthparts and muscular tail. Tadpoles commonly overwintered in upland streams, although those hatching in early summer could metamorphose before the next autumn (Richards 1992).","This species is one of seven frogs occurring in upland rainforest streams in northeastern Queensland that experienced substantial range contractions and population declines between 1988 and late 1994 (Ingram and McDonald 1993, Richards et al. 1993, Northern Queensland Threatened Frogs Recovery Team 2001). These species share the common characteristics of having a high degree of habitat specialisation, and reproduction in fast flowing streams (Williams and Hero 1998). The declines are believed to be caused by the amphibian chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) (Northern Queensland Threatened Frogs Recovery Team 2001) although dead or dying individuals of this species specifically were not found (Berger et al. 1999).Richard et al. (1993) rejected drought, floods, habitat destruction, or pollution by pesticides, inorganic ions or heavy metals as possible causes of the decline. The habitat of the species in the Wet Tropics has been protected since 1988; therefore, habitat destruction as a result of logging was no longer a threat (McDonald and Alford 1999). Feral pigs were a potential cause of riparian habitat damage and adult frog mortality (Richards et al. 1993). The activity of feral pigs has been recorded to have increased over the period 1989–1992 in an area previously inhabited by this species (Richards et al. 1993).","This species was once moderately common in suitable habitat, but then experienced a catastrophic decline. Adults were last recorded in April 1990, and tadpoles and metamorphs were last recorded in November 1990 on the Carbine Tableland (Richards et al. 1993). However, this species had apparently disappeared from sites on the Atherton Tableland much earlier (Richards et al. 1993). It was recorded from various sites on the Atherton Tableland prior to 1973 (Liem 1974), but was not encountered in Danbulla State Forest during 1989–1992 or at any Atherton Tableland site during surveys conducted between 1991 and 1992 (Richards et al. 1993). Surveys in the Wet Tropics conducted in 1991−1992, 1993 and 2011−2013 failed to locate the species from a number of historic locations and other potentially suitable habitat (Ingram and McDonald 1993, Richards et al. 1993, Trenerry et al. 1994, Hoskin and Puschendorf 2014), and Hoskin and Puschendorf (2014) concluded that the Mountain Mistfrog could be considered extinct. The Conservation Advice published for this species summarises the extensive survey efforts from 1989 to 2013 that were unsuccessful in locating any extant populations (Threatened Species Scientific Committee 2019).

The species was seen on rocks during the day near swift-flowing streams or in the rainforest leaf-litter during wet weather (McDonald 1992). Males called during the day, from first light to early evening, near rainforest streams from beneath rocks or leaves (McDonald 1992). Males appeared to establish territories, possibly as a response to seemingly low numbers of females (Dennis 1982). Breeding was observed from late November through to January (Liem and Hosmer 1973). Eggs were laid as a gelatinous clump of about 25–40 eggs (2.2–2.7mm diameter) amongst rocks in the water usually in heavily shaded locations (Liem and Hosmer 1973). Liem and Hosmer (1973) described the tadpole of the species as lotic benthic. Tadpoles generally inhabited debris in pools or slow flowing sections of streams (Liem and Hosmer 1973).","Richards et al.

Big Tableland, the area where the species was at its highest density in 1991–1992, has been mined since 1887 and logging ceased in that area in 1963 (Richards et al. 1993). Rather, research suggests the rapid, catastrophic decline of this species was due to infection with chytridiomycosis (Berger et al. 1999, Schloegel et al. 2006). Chytrid fungus has been identified on specimens of this species from the Carbine Tableland and Big Tableland (Speare and Berger 2000).Feral pigs are a potential cause of riparian habitat damage and adult frog mortality (Richards et al. 1993). The activity of feral pigs has been recorded to have increased over the period 1989–1992 in an area previously inhabited by this species (Richards et al. 1993). There is very little research, however, into the impact of feral pigs on native frog populations (Richards et al. 1993).","Formerly a conspicuous inhabitant of upland rainforest streams because of its diurnal habits and historical abundance, the species started disappearing in the southern part of its range in 1988 and had disappeared from south of the Daintree River by 1992 (Richards et al. 1993). In the past the species was considered locally abundant and in 1989, 48 calling males were recorded along a 100 m stream transect (Richards et al. 1993). When surveys of the same site were undertaken in 1990, only one adult and several tadpoles were located (Richards et al. 1993). The rapid decline of this species is well documented and, in approximately five years from 1988 to 1993, it disappeared from an area spanning about 2.5 degrees latitude (Ingram 1993). Possible sightings of a single individual in a small tributary of the South Johnstone River in 1996 (Marshall 1998), and in 1997, a gravid female seen near Mount Hartley (Hero et al. 1998), are the only records of the species since 1994 (Hero et al. 2002, Schloegel et al. 2006). Apart from these two individuals, it has not been recorded during extensive searches of suitable, known sites from the previous range of this species between 1994 and 2004 (Hero and McDonald, personal communication in Schloegel et al. 2006), and more recent extensive surveys in the region have still failed to find any individuals and it is now believed that this species is extinct (Conrad Hoskin pers. comm. 2016, Gillespie et al. 2020).","This Australian endemic species was widely distributed from Mount Graham to the Big Tableland, in northeast Queensland, at altitudes of 300–1,300 m asl (McDonald 1992).",There was no use or trade of this species.,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Conservation Actions In-PlaceIts historical range included Lumholtz, Wooroonooran, Daintree, Crater, Cedar Bay, and Tully Falls National Parks, as well as Qld Timber Reserve (165 Monkhouse), Lamb Range, Malbon Thompson Range, Herberton Range, Ravenshoe, Kirrama Range, Mt Fisher, Maalan, Mt Lewis, and Windsor State Forests (Tyler 1997). There was a captive-rearing programme run by the Melbourne Zoo and the Queensland Department of the Environment, that started in 1996.

In addition, animals were also found along watercourses in pure stands of the palm Archontophoenix cunninghamia, in exposed areas, in gorges, in dense non-forest riparian vegetation (Lomandra longifolia, Carex neurochlamys, Elatostema reticulatum and Blechnum nudum) and where the riparian vegetation had been slightly infested with Lantana camara (Czechura and Ingram 1990). Permanent streams with rocky substrates were favoured, but this species also occurred in permanent and ephemeral streams on gravel, clay, sand and soil substrates (Czechura and Ingram 1990). Active frogs had been observed all year round, although less frequently during winter months (Czechura and Ingram 1990). Breeding occurred in warm weather after or during heavy rain from late October to May, with a January to March peak (Czechura and Ingram 1990, Meyer et al. 2001). Gravid females had been reported between November and May (Straughan and Lee 1966). Amplexus was inguinal and 24–36 eggs (2.2 mm diameter) were deposited in gelatinous clumps under rocks or branches in the water (Liem and Hosmer 1973, Watson and Martin 1973, Czechura and Ingram 1990, Meyer et al. 2001). Tadpoles, illustrated by Liem and Hosmer (1973) and Watson and Martin (1973), were found throughout the year.","The reason(s) for the disappearance of this species remains unknown. Like Rheobatrachus silus, logging has occurred in catchments occupied by the species (Hines et al. 1999); however, the effect of timber harvesting on the species has not been investigated. The species’ habitat is currently threatened by feral pigs, invasion of weed species (especially Mist Flower) and altered stream flow and water quality due to upstream disturbances (Hines et al. 1999). The species was not found in areas along watercourses that were heavily infested with Lantana camara or where the weeds Baccharis halimifolia and Ageratina riparia (Mist Flower) occurred (Czechura and Ingram 1990). The frogs were also absent from streams with very muddy water associated with the activities of feral pigs (Czechura and Ingram 1990). From what is known from similar declines and disappearance elsewhere in the world, the disease chytridiomycosis also must be suspected as a cause for the decline.","In the early 1970s this species was considered to be relatively common (McEvoy et al. 1979), but following a very rapid decline it has not been sighted in the wild since 1979 despite continued efforts to relocate the species (Hines et al. 1999). The disappearance of the species occurred over a period of three to four years, disappearing from the D’Aguilar Range in late 1975, then from the Blackall Range in late 1978, and finally from the Conondale Range in early 1979 (Czechura and Ingram 1990). There is no information on population size, structure, genetics or dynamics (Hines et al. 1999). This species is now believed to be extinct.","This Australian endemic species occurred in disjunctive subpopulations in three sub-coastal mountain ranges (Blackall, Conondale, and D’Aguilar Ranges) in southeast Queensland from Coonoon Gibber Creek in the north, to Mount Glorious in the south (Czechura and Ingram 1990, Hines et al. 1999). The extent of occurrence (EOO) of the species was about 1,400 km2 (map in Hines et al. 1999). The species occurred over a relatively narrow altitudinal range of 350-800 m asl with most records falling between 500–800 m asl (Czechura and Ingram 1990).",There was no use or trade of this species.,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Conservation Actions In-PlaceThe species was formerly known from Kondalilla, Conondale, Mapleton Falls, Obi Obi Gorge, Maiala, and Manorina National Parks (Tyler 1997).",Australasian,Global

Falkland Islands habitat generally comprises rocky scrub, marsh and grassland, and dwarf shrub heath (Falklands Conservation 2012).","The species was hunted by Argentine settlers in early 1800s, and by US fur traders in the 1830s. Due to being tame and curious and unafraid of humans, it was particularly susceptible to culling. Scottish settlers and their sheep flocks arrived in the 1860s and considered D. australis a pest and a threat to their sheep, setting fire to brushwood and laying out poison baits.","Dusicyon australis probably reached the Falkland Islands from the mainland 480 km away during the last glacial age (Slater et al. 2009).

The abundant fossils of Dusicyon avus show a clear archaeological and temporal overlap with modern humans. A specimen was discovered in a grave from the late second millennium BC, suggesting that the animal might have been kept as a pet (Prates 2014); the teeth of Dusicyon avus were used in a religions context in some aboriginal sites of Buenos Aires province. According to new radiocarbon evidence, the species would have become extinct about 326-496 years BP (Prevosti et al. 2015), supporting the hypothesis that its disappearance might have happened after the arrival of Europeans. Anecdotal evidence exists from the diaries of 19th century naturalists and explorers of a large canid in Patagonia attributable to Dusicyon avus. Prevosti et al.

In particular, declines appear to have taken place in most native lizard species following the introduction of the Indian Wolf Snake (Lycodon capucinus) in the early 1980s (Andrew et al. 2016), and Wolf Snake predation is now understood to be the proximate cause of this skink's extinction.

Duméril and Bibron (1837) however refer to Iles de Trinite (=Trinidad), but there is no evidence that any member of this genus ever occurred on Trinidad and the association of the Trinite locality with the island is likely to have been an error made by the describing authors. The locality data associated with subsequent specimens includes records from both Martinique and Trinidad, but the latter may have been simply a transit port (Pregill 1992).","There is no use or trade in this species, which is extinct.",Terrestrial,"No conservation measures are applicable to this species, which is extinct.",Neotropical,Global

Barbados is a very heavily-developed island and numerous introduced species, including mongoose, cats and rats, are widespread. The magnitude of these threats to a ground-dwelling snake, combined with evidence of historical decline, leaves little reasonable doubt that - although seen alive comparatively recently, little more than 50 years ago - this species is now extinct.",This ground snake occurred in mesic habitats (Henderson and Powell 2009). It was an egg laying species (Henderson and Powell 2009).,"Mongoose were introduced to Barbados in the 1870s, and the species seems to have declined drastically from that period. The four specimens reported by Elmsley (1963) were from a locality identified as being in St. Joseph Parish on the border with St. John (Underwood et al. 1999). The species has never since been recorded. This record - from the most remote area of the island - is consistent with a remnant population close to extinction, and the lack of any subsequent records strongly suggests that it has now been lost. There are only around 20 ha of forest remaining on Barbados, a heavily-developed island.It is not known whether this species was able to survive in degraded habitats, although the last recorded specimens include records from the grounds of a school. Repeated targeted surveys aiming to rediscover this species have failed to record it, and it is presumed to be extinct.",The species hasn't been recorded since 1963; it was formerly probably widespread and was reportedly common on Barbados (Underwood et al. 1999). Declines appear to have coincided with the introduction of mongoose to Barbados. Emsley (1963) reported that the species appeared to be abundant as recently as 1960; the same author reported that it had previously been considered extinct and recorded four specimens from an unnamed locality. The reliability of this testimony is unclear as it is possible this represents confusion with Mastigodryas bruesi. The snake has never since been recorded.,"This species is known only from historical records from Barbados, from which it was last recorded in 1963 (Underwood et al. 1999). More recent reports represent confusion with Mastigodryas bruesi, thought to be an introduction to the island. The history of these two species on Barbados is very confused; descriptions from the 17th Century of snakes on the island refer to an arboreal snake, and Erythrolamprus are typically terrestrial or aquatic. This suggests either that M. bruesi may have been introduced either early in the colonial period or in the pre-Columbian period, or that this species too is native to Barbados, complicating efforts to infer the historical status of Erytholamprus perfuscus on the island from the literature.","There is no use of or trade in this species, which is extinct.",Terrestrial,"No conservation measures are possible for this species, which is extinct.

It is hypothesized that a bounty system established to encourage killings of vipers may have resulted in the loss of this snake (Underwood 1993), however the loss of a Clelia species from Grenada in the 1960s - where no such bounty was set - calls this into question as a primary cause of extinction. Mongoose were introduced to Saint Lucia in the 19th Century, however adult mussuranas are sufficiently large that mongoose would not threaten them. The precise timing of this species' extinction is unclear, and the species might have vanished or been in decline before mongoose arrived.

While the continued survival of a remote mainland population cannot be completely ruled out, this island has been subject to sufficiently intensive herpetological survey work that there is thought to be no reasonable doubt that this species is extinct.","No ecological or reproductive information is associated with this species (Hedges and Conn 2012). This species might have been arboreal, in common with some other Alinea species (S.B.

Secondary threats include habitat destruction from agriculture and urbanization, and predation from other introduced predators, including black rats (Hedges and Conn 2012). If a remnant population survives, the failure to record it for over 120 years despite targeted searches - as well as extensive general herpetological research throughout Saint Lucia and its satellites - suggests that it must be very restricted. Previously widespread skinks on other islands, such as Jamaica, have been found to persist in very restricted areas (Hedges and Conn 2012). This is however not thought likely to be realistic for the Saint Lucia skink, a large lizard on a herpetologically very well-studied island from which another lizard species has been lost following the introduction of rats and mongoose (J.

Redonda's native habitat is likely to have been open dry forest (Bell and Daltry 2010, Morse 1979); much of this was cleared during guano mining activity - as Redonda is home to a large seabird colony - probably shortly after this skink was collected. Remaining native vegetation is almost entirely gone following invasion of the island by rats and goats, and there is no recruitment into surviving tree population. It would have been terrestrial, either on rocks or in leaf litter while this still existed.","It is likely that black rats preyed on this terrestrial lizard (Hedges and Conn 2012), and it may have been reliant to some degree on native vegetation, invertebrates and litter structure which has now been lost. Almost no vegetation remains on Redonda due to overgrazing by goats.

Although a wild population has since been reintroduced into its native range, a self-sustaining breeding population has not successfully been re-established, and the species is entirely reliant on intensive management and the release of captive-bred individuals for successful recruitment.","Historically, this species is associated with floodplain ponds along the Big and Little Laramie Rivers. It is known to inhabit a variety of wetland habitats, including lakes, ponds, streams, marshes, and roadside ditches (Green et al. 2014). The use of lakes might have been limited due to saline conditions, however it is possible that irrigation might have flushed out the lakes and made them more suitable for toads (G. Baxter pers. comm.). Individuals use rodent burrows for shelter, and are inactive during the cold season. Breeding takes place from mid-May to mid-June, and larvae metamorphose by early August. This species is a colonial breeder, although breeding aggregations tend to be small. Adults feed on a variety of small terrestrial arthropods, while larvae eat organic debris, algae, and plant tissue.","This species is particularly at risk due to its extremely limited distribution and small population size, and is is entirely dependent on captive releases for its survival in the wild. A lack of genetic diversity might also limit this species' abundance in the Laramie Basin. The primary threats within its range include the lack of suitable habitat available for future reintroductions within its historic range, and the infectious disease chytridiomycosis caused by the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Mortenson Lake is known to be infected with the amphibian chytrid fungus (Bd) (USFWS 2002). This fungus has been implicated in declines and extinctions of amphibian species worldwide. Retrospective analysis shows that the fungus has been present at Mortenson Lake since at least 1989, and it continues to pose a major threat to this species. In 2003, a die-off of Wyoming toads at Mortenson Lake was attributed to Bd, and results from USFWS surveys conducted from 2008–2010 reported 67–100% Bd positive rates in tested toads (Polasik et al. 2015). In addition, chytridiomycosis has been recorded within the captive population. Additional threats to the species include predation (especially by mustelids), pesticide use, and ongoing irrigation practices. The cause of the original decline remains unknown but might be associated with the invasion of chytrid into the area (USFWS 2002). Mortenson Lake has also experienced ongoing habitat degradation, including becoming more saline (and less suitable for toads) as a result of drought-related increases in evaporation (USFWS 2002e). Additionally, the height and density of vegetation may be greater around Mortenson Lake than it historically was due to decreased intensity of cattle grazing and lack of fire. Previous observations of this species recorded individuals surviving in close association with cattle grazing, so this change in management practices could be causing habitat degradation (Polasik et al. 2015).","This species was common in the 1950s, but underwent a large decline in the 1960s and 1970s. This species was federally listed as endangered in 1984, and was presumed extinct by 1985 (Baxter and Stromberg 1980, Stromberg 1981, Vankirk 1980, Baxter et al. 1982, Baxter and Stone 1985, Lewis et al. 1985). A small extant population consisting of approximately 100–150 adults was discovered at Mortenson Lake in 1987 (Stone 1991), and the population continued to reproduce successfully with all life stages represented until 1989. On September 1, 1989 the last ten remaining individuals were removed from Mortenson Lake and taken into captivity (McCleary 1989, USFWS 2015). Captive breeding began in mid-1990s using the toads taken from Mortenson Lake and reintroduction efforts were started in 1995 (USFWS 2002, 2015). Despite over 20 years of reintroduction efforts (over 187,000 individuals were released from 1995 to 2013), breeding populations of the Wyoming Toad have not re-established (Dodd 2013, Polasik et al. 2015). As of 2017, the population was known to have 1,500 individuals in existence across five sites, with this number experiencing dramatic fluctuations year-to-year (NPR 2017). There is little wild breeding taking place and no breeding activity has been documented in recent years at any of the currently known sites. Thus, none of these populations is currently self-sustaining (USFWS 2015). Despite releases of captive-reared individuals, the population at Mortenson Lake NWR appears to be declining (USFWS 2002).","This species is restricted to the Laramie Basin in Albany County, Wyoming, USA. Historically, this species was commonly found across 1,820 km2 of the Laramie Basin. It was presumed extinct by 1985 (Baxter and Stromberg 1980, Stromberg 1981, Vankirk 1980, Baxter et al. 1982, Baxter and Stone 1985, Lewis et al. 1985). In 1987, a small remnant population was discovered at Mortenson Lake (Stone 1991). In 1989, all remaining wild individuals from Mortenson Lake were taken into captivity, and reintroduction efforts were started in 1995 (McCleary 1989, USFWS 2015). All wild-occurring toads are considered to be the product of reintroduction efforts (USFWS 2015). This species' distribution is now restricted to Mortenson Lake National Wildlife Refuge and two private land sites protected under the Wyoming Toad Safe Harbor Agreements (USFWS 2015).

There are two captive populations. An apparently suitable forest remnant has been identified for future reintroduction efforts.,"The species was apparently confined to lowland primary forest, where it was known to take fruit of Phyllanthus, Eugenia and ""mangabeira"" (see Muñoz and Kattan 2007). In captivity, the female lays two or three eggs per clutch. The age of youngest breeding female was two years (del Hoyo 1994).","The extinction of this species had been forecast since its discovery. Ceaseless clearance of its lowland forest habitat, chiefly for sugarcane, and poaching had soon brought it to the verge of extinction. Sugarcane demand increased dramatically in the late 1970s, owing to a government programme to increase fuel alcohol production, hastening the destruction of remaining habitat. Pesticide-use in cane fields surrounding extant forest may also have had a detrimental effect. The last remaining area of reasonably extensive lowland forest in the region was virtually entirely cleared within six months in the late 1980s, while continued hunting served only to exacerbate the species's decline. The captive population, which was established from only three individuals, has been undergoing a severe bottleneck with a drastic decrease in genetic diversity (Costa et al. 2017). However, despite the loss of genetic diversity and the subsequent hybridization with M. tuberosum, several purebred M. mitu have persisted throughout the 35 years of captive breeding (Costa et al. 2017).","A captive population was established in Rio de Janeiro in 1977. Currently the population is kept in two aviaries, numbering over 100 purebred individuals and additionally around 40 hybrids of M. mitu and the Amazonian Razor-billed Curassow M. tuberosum (Pereira et al. 2014). In 2017, two individuals were transferred to an aviary in Mata do Cedro to prepare for the reintroduction.

Since the early 1970s, there are records from four forests in this region. Most likely, the species was uncommon and not widespread within its presumed historical distribution (Silveira et al. 2004): Numbers were probably as few as 20, even in the 1960s (del Hoyo 1994).

A 30 km2 forest remnant in Alagoas (Reserva Particular do Patrimonio Natural Mata do Cedro) has been identified for potential reintroduction attempts by the government of Alagoas (Grau et al. 2003, Gama et al. 2016). In autumn 2017, the first two individuals were transferred to a 400 m2 aviary in Mata do Cedros to adapt to the reintroduction site. The reintroduction is scheduled to start in 2018 (Lisboa 2017).

The species has not been observed in the wild since the 1970s and no ex situ populations exist, therefore the species is assessed as Extinct.","Lake Constance is a monomictic, perialpine, naturally oligotrophic lake formed after the last glacial period. It has a total surface area of 536 km2, divided between the large (472 km2), deep (&gt;250 metres) Upper Lake (de. Obersee) and the smaller (63 km2), shallower Lower Lake (de. Untersee).The Strumose Whitefish was a relatively small species that mostly inhabited the profundal zone at depths exceeding 100 metres. The annual reproductive period took place during summer, although some reports suggest that it extended from July to November, and spawning took place at depths of 10-60 metres. It fed primarily on zoobenthos, particularly molluscs.Four whitefish species which differ in traits related to feeding and reproductive ecology along depth gradients were native to the lake prior to extinction of the Strumose Whitefish. The other three remain extant, and comprise the pelagic-spawning Blaufelchen (Coregonus wartmanni), inshore-spawning Gangfisch (C. macrophthalmus) and demersal Sandfelchen (C. arenicolus).Two additional whitefish populations have been recognised in the Lake Constance system. One mostly inhabits the Lower Lake and is sometimes referred to as Coregonus sp. ""Weissfelchen"", while the other is restricted to the Upper Lake but migrates into the Alpine Rhine River for spawning and is therefore known as C. sp. ""Alpenrheinfelchen"". These might represent still-undescribed species, although genetic analyses indicate that C. sp. ""Alpenrheinfelchen"" is potentially conspecific with the Sandfelchen.","A rising human population in the Lake Constance catchment during the 20th century drove the development of industry and agriculture, which led to increasing pollution from domestic wastewater and runoff. The lake subsequently entered a phase of eutrophication which peaked in 1979 and led to periodic stratification and hypolimnetic anoxia. The Strumose Whitefish is understood to have become extinct during this period since it was a stenotypic resident of the profundal zone and unable to survive in the deoxygenated hypolimnion. In addition, the natural reproduction of the remaining whitefish stock was inhibited, since their eggs could no longer develop in the oxygen-depleted substrata.Upper Lake Constance has since returned to its former oligotrophic state following the successful implementation of management measures, while the Lower Lake is currently mesotrophic.","This species has probably been extinct since the 1970s, since when no individuals have been reported in commercial landings or scientific surveys.","This species was endemic to Lake Constance (fr.

By the mid-2000s, water was being legally abstracted from 29 individual sites, while an undetermined number of illicit boreholes supplying private residences had also been drilled.Non-native fish taxa introduced to the Peța River include Topmouth Gudgeon (Pseudorasbora parva), Brown Bullhead (Ameiurus nebulosus) and a number of ornamental species that were presumably released by aquarists. The presence of these is likely to have increased resource competition and predation pressure on the Racovitza's Rudd population.Moreover, the cooling water temperatures plausibly impacted recruitment by disrupting physiological processes associated with reproduction and altering the structure of planktonic and zoobenthic communities in the lake. Foraging and reproductive success may have been further compromised by agricultural (nutrients, pesticides and sediments) and domestic (garbage and wastewater) pollution from an affluent stream, which led to increased eutrophication, siltation and the development of a thick organic substrate layer due to overgrowth of the invasive plants Ceratopteris thalictroides, Bacopa sp. and Elodea sp..The population size of Racovitza's Rudd is thus believed to have been somewhat reduced prior to dewatering of the lake, which took place over a period of several years. The sublacustrine source spring first became inactive during December 2011, when a sudden decline in depth and surface area was observed. Flow was briefly reestablished in spring 2012, but by the end of that year the lake had been reduced to a small pond measuring a few metres in diameter which was maintained only by intermittent pumping of water from a nearby borehole. These conditions were exacerbated by a series of consecutive dry summers, and in September 2014 the lake completely dried out. This pattern has been repeated in subsequent years, with active groundwater discharge restricted to a short period each spring. By 2017, the number of operational extraction wells had fallen by more than half, indicating severe depletion of the geothermal aquifer.","This species' wild population became extinct in September 2014, following an extended period of declining habitat quality (see 'Threats'). A number of ex situ subpopulations are currently established (see 'Conservation').","This species was endemic to a single small lake fed by a geothermal spring in the vicinity of Oradea, Bihor County, northwestern Romania. The lake, known locally as Pețea or Ochiul Mare, is located in the upper reaches of the Peța River, a minor left-bank tributary of the Crișul Repede (hu. Sebes-Körös) River in the upper Tisza River system. The Tisza is itself a major affluent of the Danube River.",This species is not used or traded.,Freshwater (=Inland waters),"This species is included in Appendix III of the Bern Convention (as Rutilus racovitzai).Lake Pețea and the surrounding area lie within the boundaries of a protected area created in 1932, which was added to the European Union's Natura 2000 network in 2007 (site ROSCI0098). Racovitza's Rudd is not listed as a target species.In 2012, fears over deteriorating habitat quality resulted in 60 individuals, comprising 58 females and 2 males, being collected from the wild and transferred to the Țării Crișurilor Museum in Oradea with the aid of financial support from the Mohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund. Some of these individuals were later transferred to the Hungarian University of Agriculture and Life Sciences (MATE, formerly Szent István University) in Budapest, Hungary, where reproduction was artificially induced. Around 5,000 individuals were successfully reared as a result of these efforts, which were split between several institutions in order to establish multiple ex situ subpopulations. As of early 2024, stocks are maintained at the Țării Crișurilor Museum (Oradea, Romania), Răsvan Angheluțăq Museum of Natural Sciences (Galați, Romania), MATE, Schönbrunn Zoo (Vienna, Austria), Plzeň Zoo (Plzeň, Czechia) and Tropicarium (Budapest, Hungary).The Lake Pețea ecosystem and its endemic fauna and flora were targeted by the 'Conservation and protection of ecosystems endangered by lack of thermal and freshwater in crossborder area' project, which took place from 2018-2021 and was co-funded by the European Union within the Interreg Europe interregional cooperation programme (project code ROHU-29). A series of useful studies and conservation activities were completed through a collaboration between the Oradea Metropolitan Development Association, University of Oradea, Aqua Crisius Angling Association and the HUN-REN Institute for Nuclear Research (Debrecen, Hungary), although none of them resulted in long-term outcomes for Racovitza's Rudd.The reestablishment of this species in the wild is currently precluded by a lack of stable hydrological conditions at the former Lake Pețea, the restoration of which should be treated as a conservation priority. The development of sustainable water abstraction protocols is likely to represent the most effective initial management strategy. If the lake's water level can be restored, a period of monitoring should ideally be implemented in order to assess its ecological status prior to any direct reintroduction efforts.",Palearctic,Global & Europe

In 1981, the construction of the Gezhouba Dam in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River blocked the migration route, preventing adult fish moving to the upper reaches to spawn. Juveniles were last recorded in the upper reaches of the river in 1992, suggesting that few individuals might have been able to survive and reproduce above the dam. The last individual was observed in 2003. Despite intense surveys, no remaining individuals have been detected and there is no chance that such a large and enigmatic species has survived unnoticed. Therefore, this species is now assessed as Extinct.","The Chinese Paddlefish was anadromous (spent at least part of its life in the estuary and the sea and migrated upriver to reproduce). The species occurred in the main stem of large rivers, staying usually in middle and lower layers of the water column, and occasionally swimming into large lakes. Its spawning period was in March and April. Spawning sites were located in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. Available information also indicates that spawning took place in the lower Jinsha River between Shuifu and Yibin (Liu and Zeng 1988, Li et al. 1997). Psephurus gladius was a piscivorous species, and the largest individual recorded was 7 m in length and weighed over several thousand pounds.","The Chinese Paddlefish was heavily overfished. Even fry of Psephurus gladius, forming schools along the river, were easily captured in traditional Chinese fishing nets and set nets (Zhang et al. 2009). All age classes were taken whenever possible. Its long generation time (e.g. late sexual maturation and large size) made it very vulnerable to overharvest.In 1981 the Gezhouba Dam was built in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, blocking the migration route and preventing adult fish moving to the upper reaches of the river to spawn. Due to early depletion of the stocks and the difficulties to keep it in aquaculture, no ex situ population was established.","The species is now extinct (Zhang et al. 2020). After the last finding of the species in 2003, the distribution area was surveyed intensively but without success and there have been also no reports or sightings from other waters. There is no hope that this large and enigmatic species might have survived unnoticed.From the mid-20th century the population of the Chinese Paddlefish decreased rapidly. Incidental capture data between 1982–2003 from the upper, mid and lower sections of the Yangtze indicate the largest number was found in 1985, when 32 individuals were captured in the lower section (below the Gezhouba Dam) (Zhang et al. 2009). In 1995 juveniles were recorded below the Gezhouba Dam of the Yangtze River (Chen 2007).Two juvenile individuals (1.2 kg weight, 47 cm total length; 1.3 kg weight, 50 cm total length) were still found in the Chongqing reach in 1992 (Chen 2007). In 2002, an adult female (body length 330 cm, weight 117 kg) was captured in the section of Jiangsu Nanjing of the Yangtze River. Urgent attempts were made to safeguard this individual, but it only survived for 30 days in captivity. On January 24th, 2003, another adult female (body length 352 cm) was accidentally caught in Yibin, Sichuan Province China (upper reach of Yangtze River). It was tagged with an ultra-sonic tag and released by Dr. Wei’s team from the Yangtze River Fisheries Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences. Unfortunately, after 12 hours of tracking, communication was disconnected and contact with the fish got lost. Between 2006 and 2008, Dr. Wei’s team used a number of boats to deploy 4,762 setlines, 111 anchored setlines and 950 drift nets covering a stretch of 412.5 km of the upper Yangtze River attempting to catch the last remaining individuals, but failed to get a single one (Zhang et al. 2009). The team also used hydroacoustic equipment to survey the river, also without success (Zhang et al. 2009). Time of extinction was estimated to be by around 2005 and in any case no later than by 2010. The Chinese Paddlefish reached functional extinction in during the early 1990s (Zhang et al.2020).","The Chinese Paddlefish was found in the Yangtze River in China. They spent part of their life in the lower section of the Yangtze, including the brackish estuary water, migrated upstream into the Yangtze for spawning, which occurred in Spring from mid-March to early April.

The last reliable wild record dates from 1900, and a search beginning in 1910 failed to find it.","It was a nomadic species, breeding and foraging in vast flocks millions of birds strong. It exploited seasonally available crops of beechmast, acorns and chestnuts; scouting for food sources and infomation sharing was likely to have required flocks of a certain critical size, below which survival would be compromised. Birds nested in April or May in vast colonies typically 16 by 5 km in size.","The precise cause of its extinction is difficult to determine, but the widespread clearance of the hardwood trees which provided its mast food, and the proliferation of the rail network and telegraph system which enabled efficient location of nesting colonies and the transport of young birds to market are probably the two single most important factors. Other important factors were excessive shooting, Newcastle disease, and towards the last of their years, the breakdown of social facilitation (Halliday 1980, Blockstein and Tordoff 1985, Bucher 1992).",None remain.,"Ectopistes migratorius was found in forest in eastern and central Canada and the USA, occasionally wandering south to Mexico and Cuba.

Following the application of new methods for estimating the probability of a species remaining extant, the species is now considered to be Extinct in the Wild. The species's decline was primarily the result of trapping for trade plus habitat loss.","It was found in the caatinga scrub zone, apparently requiring gallery woodland dominated by caraiba Tabebuia caraiba trees for nesting, but feeding mainly on two regionally characteristic Euphorbiaceae plant species. Breeding occurred during the austral summer. Two or three eggs were laid in the wild (up to five in captivity). The wild bird and the P. maracana apparently produced infertile eggs, although one experienced very early embryo death, subsequent DNA analysis revealing a hybrid.","The decline of the species has generally been attributed to two principal factors. First, long-term destruction of the specific gallery woodland habitat on which the species apparently depended, the result of the colonisation and exploitation of the region along the rio São Francisco corridor during more than three centuries. Secondly, trapping for the illegal live bird trade in recent decades pushed the species towards extinction. In addition, the colonisation of the distributional range by introduced aggressive African bees, and the building of the Sobradinho hydroelectric dam above Juazeiro may have contributed, perhaps significantly, to the species's decline in the 1970s and 1980s. Direct hunting is considered a factor of minor importance in the overall decline (Barros et. al. 2012), even though several reports of shooting are on record. The remaining caatinga habitat has suffered degradation and clearance as a result of grazing by cattle and goats (Barros et. al. 2012).",The species is now considered to be Extinct in the Wild (Butchart et. al. 2018).,"This species was known for over 150 years, from small numbers of traded birds and a hunted bird taken by von Spix, until it was traced in 1985-1986 to near the rio São Francisco in north Bahia, Brazil. Only three birds remained and these were captured for trade in 1987 and 1988. However, a single male, paired with a female Blue-winged Macaw Propyrrhura maracana, was discovered at the site in July 1990. A female C. spixii was released from captivity in 1995 and initially paired with the male. Unfortunately, the female disappeared from the release site after seven weeks and is suspected to have collided with a power-line (Caparroz et al. 2001). The wild bird was still paired with the female P. maracana in January 2000 (Y. de Melo Barros in litt. 1999, 2000) but neither bird has been seen since the end of that year. In 2000, the total number of publicly declared birds in captivity was 60, but 54 of these were captive-bred (Schischakin 2000). The official captive population in 2015 totalled over 100 individuals (EcoAmericas 2015), with further individuals in private ownership. There have been occasional local reports, including from Serra da Capivara National Park, and a bird was filmed near Curaçá in June 2016, but this is now thought to have been a release from captivity. There have been no other records since 2000, despite fieldworker presence and surveying effort. Following the application of new methods for estimating the probability of a species remaining extant (Akcakaya et al. 2017, Keith et al. 2017, Thompson et al. 2017) the probability of Spix's Macaw being extant in the wild was estimated at 0.00006 based on records and surveys, and 0.083 based on threats (Butchart et al. 2018).

The precise causes of the recent population decline are unknown (Rosa et al. 1998), although a correlation with a concurrent 473% increase in pig activity within the Hanawi NAR has been hypothesised, as indexed by ground-cover disturbance (Mountainspring et al. 1990). Predation by introduced rats, cats and small Indian mongooses Herpestes auropunctatus is also possible.

Following the application of new methods for estimating the probability of a species remaining extant, the species is now considered to be Extinct. The species's decline was largely a result of logging, felling for charcoal and conversion of forest to sugarcane plantations and pastureland.","It inhabited the edges of clearings in interior upland forest at 400-550 m, from the understorey to the subcanopy, and has been observed in selectively logged and old secondary forests. Birds have been found singly, in pairs or small groups, and often joined mixed-species flocks. Food was gleaned from leaves, bark, crevices and debris, and consisted of insects, including larvae taken from dead wood, beetles, grasshoppers and ants. Observations suggest the species preferentially foraged on bromeliads (Lees et al. 2014). There is little breeding information, but an immature was collected in January, and birds in February were moulting (Ridgely and Tudor 1994). One of the individuals at the Jaqueira (Frei Caneca) Reserve in 2007/2008 was observed in secondary forest (P.

However, these sub-populations belong to a putative new species (X. apodaca).

Both known sites have been destroyed, and catastrophic declines occurred during the 1960s–1980s due to the combined effects of multiple severe threats. Extensive searches in the appropriate habitat, during the appropriate season within the known range, since 1964 have failed to locate this species.","This species occurred in primary forest in the Atlantic Forest biome. It inhabited low vegetation on the border of streams in gallery forest (Bokermann 1963). There is no information on breeding habits, but reproduction might have taken place by larval development in streams. It was a medium-sized treefrog with loud and very characteristic vocalizations, making it easy to detect.","This species disappeared in the late 1960s or 1970s after suffering severe declines due to a number of threats. Both known sites have been destroyed by infrastructure development. The type locality was destroyed when the new Estação Ferroviária Campo Grande (railway station) was built in the early 1970s. The second locality was previously on the outskirts of the city of Sao Paulo, and was destroyed by significant urban expansion that took place during the middle of the last century (1950s–1970s) and continues to this day. This site is currently a parking lot (P. Garcia pers. comm. 2021).However, the Serra da Paranapiacaba still contains a large extent of  intact, suitable forest habitat and the species likely occurred at other sites within the Serra, and between the Serra and the city of Sao Paulo. It is the synergistic effects of pollution, disease, and habitat degradation that are suspected to have caused the species' extinction where habitat loss did not (Carvalho et al. 2017). The coastal city of Cubatão is highly industrialized and contains oil and gas refineries, chemical manufacturing plants, and other industrial activities. It infamously caused severe air pollution in the city of Sao Paulo in the 1970s and 1980s. The resulting acid rain caused changes in forest cover and humidity in the forests of the Serra da Paranapiacaba and Serra do Mar (Brazilian Red List Assessment Workshop 2021). The amphibian chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), is thought to have arrived in the Serra do Mar in the 1970s or 1980s (Carvalho et al. 2017). The overlap in the timing of these threats, and their extreme severity, are thought to have caused rapid declines across the entire distribution.","This species is known from five individuals collected in 1962 from the type locality (Bokermann 1963, Lutz 1973, Faivovich et al. 2021). Only one individual is known from the Nova Manchester locality and was identified from museum collections by Faivovich et al. (2021); it is presumed to have also been collected in the 1960s although there is no collection date provided with the museum records. The only known recording of this species' call was made by Bokermann in 1963 at the type locality (Faivovich et al. 2021).Dozens of targeted surveys back to the type locality have taken place since 1963 by experienced researchers, including W.C.A. Bokermann who collected the type series, but all were unsuccessful (Brazilian Red List Assessment Workshop 2021). The Serra de Paranapiacaba is the type locality of many other species, and occurs within the broader Serra do Mar of Sao Paulo State, which has been subject to hundreds of surveys over the decades. The second site was on the outskirts of the city of Sao Paulo in the 1960s, but has since been engulfed by urbanisation and has been destroyed. Population declines are inferred to have taken place throughout the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. The species is extinct at both known sites and is estimated to have gone extinct in the wider Serra da Paranapiacaba by the end of the 1980s as a result of catastrophic declines caused by the synergistic effects of multiple severe threats.","This Brazilian species was known from only two sites: one at the Estação Ferroviária de Campo Grande (type locality) in the municipality of Santo André within the Serra de Paranapiacaba (Bokermann 1963); and another about 35 km away in the district of Nova Manchester in the municipality of São Paulo, in the state of São Paulo (Faivovich et al. 2021).

Egg clutches were likely laid as several rows of eggs and deposited outside of the water in rock crevices above the water; eggless capsules were likely present in the egg clutch. After hatching, tadpoles likely developed in these water bodies until metamorphosis (Lutz and Lutz 1939, Izecksohn and Cruz 1976, Heyer et al. 1990, Baêta et al. 2016).","The primary threats suspected of causing major population declines are the synergistic effects of severe air pollution and the amphibian fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Verdade et al. 2011). A similar species, Phrynomedusa dryade has tested positive for Bd infection (Toledo et al. 2006) and could therefore have played a role in the decline and disappearance of this species.The species' submontane slopes in Paranapiacaba face the city of Cubatão, a highly industrialized city containing oil and gas refineries, chemical manufacturing plants, and other industrial activities. Similar to other well-known coastal metropolitan areas bounded by mountains, the city's location at the base of the Serra do Mar trapped the air causing dangerous levels of pollution in the 1970s and 1980s. The smog produced by these industries was blown inland by the sea breeze to the large metropolitan area of São Paulo and the resulting acid rain degraded the rainforest of the Serra do Mar. The impact of this pollution on the environment and human health of inhabitants of Cubatão and São Paulo spawned campaigns that brought about changes to industrial practices that persist to this day. It is therefore not unreasonable to assume that the effects of severe habitat degradation, combined with additional pressure from a pathogen known to have negatively affected many stream-dwelling montane species, caused catastrophic declines in this species during the 1970s and 1980s from which it has not recovered.The habitat in the Serra da Araracuara is intact and not threatened.","The species is known from the holotype collected in 1898 (Miranda-Ribeiro 1923) and one individual collected in the 1950s (D. Baêta  unpubl. data). Despite efforts to rediscover this species, no records in the wild have been made (Trevine et al. 2014, Baêta et al. 2016). A project is underway using eDNA techniques to search for populations of missing amphibian species in Brazil, including this species (D. Baêta pers. comm. 2021).","This Brazilian endemic species is thought to be Extinct. It was known only from the type locality in Alto da Serra (Paranapiacaba), in the municipality of Santo André, São Paulo state, south-eastern Brazil, around 1,000 m asl. Taxonomic revision efforts of the genus Phrynomedusa in historical material deposited in museum collections recently revealed that this species had a wider historical range than is currently known: one individual from Paraná State in the Serra de Araracuara was identified and was previously thought to belong to P. appendiculata (D.

It is therefore classified as Extinct in the Wild. However, there are c.150 birds in captivity and reintroduction of the species is planned.","It was apparently commonest in forested areas above 500 m, dominated by Bumelia, Prunus serotina, Guettarda, Ilex, Psidium and Ficus. It was a highly terrestrial frugivore, and probably depended on an intact understorey of ferns and euphorbias.","The decline and extinction in the wild of this species has been attributed chiefly to predation by cats. However, it was thought that cats became feral on Socorro in the 1950s, but this date has now been revised to the early 1970s (J. E. Martínez-Gómez in litt. 1999, 2000). This suggests that other factors, such as human predation (Martínez-Gómez et al. 2003) and high levels of understorey grazing by sheep, may have been significant. Outbreaks of a permanent locust Schistocerca piceifrons swarm have occurred twice a year since 1994, resulting in damage to the leaves, flowers and fruit of indigenous forests, with at least 30 ha lost to defoliation so far, thus reducing the extent of prime habitat for the species (J. E. Martínez-Gómez in litt. 2007). Locust outbreaks may be favoured by the habitat degradation caused by introduced species (Song et al. 2006).","Fortunately, aviculture has prevented the extinction of the species, with captive populations held in around 30 institutions in the U.S.A., Europe and Mexico, with at least 70 institutions participating at some point in the captive breeding efforts since 1994 (J. E. Martínez-Gómez in litt. 2016). The European breeding programme for this endangered species has monitored the captive population for more than 30 years (J. E. Martínez-Gómez in litt. 2007). The captive population was thought to total several hundred birds, but hybridisation with Mourning Doves Z. macroura became a major problem in the U.S.A. in the 1990s (Martínez-Gómez et al. 2003), and it now appears that many of these U.S. birds are hybrids (J. E. Martínez-Gómez in litt. 1999, 2000, S. G. Stadler in litt. 2012). As a consequence of the occurrence of avian influenza in Europe in 2006, the Socorro Dove Project sent a total of 12 birds to Albuquerque Biological Park to form a second, independent reserve population nearer to the species's native country (S. G. Stadler in litt. 2012). The total captive population is currently estimated at approximately 150 individuals (J. E. Martínez-Gómez in litt. 2016). In 2013 and again in 2014 a number of birds were transferred to Mexico to form a national captive breeding flock ahead of efforts to eventually return the species to Socorro Island (H. Horblit in litt. 2013, J. E. Martínez-Gómez in litt. 2016).","This species has been extirpated from Socorro in the Revillagigedo Islands, Mexico. It was formerly common and observations in 1957 and 1958 gave no indication that it was declining. The last sighting in the wild was in 1972 (Baptista and Martínez-Gómez 1996), and all suitable habitat on the island has been surveyed subsequently without recording the dove (J. E. Martínez-Gómez in litt. 1999, 2000). Several individuals were taken during an expedition to the islands in 1925 and subsequently bred in the U.S.A., with some sent to Europe (Martínez-Gómez et al. 2003).",,Terrestrial,"Conservation Actions UnderwayThe Revillagigedo Islands were declared a biosphere reserve in 1994 (Stattersfield et al. 1998, Martínez-Gómez et al. 2003). The European Association of Zoos and Aquaria recognised a breeding programme for the species, as initiated by Cologne and Frankfurt zoos (Germany) and the private interest group Wild Pigeons and Doves, as an official European Endangered species programme (EEP), in 1995 (Martínez-Gómez et al. 2003). Modern studbook software has been employed to assist with the genetic and demographic management of the captive population. Individuals have been distributed to zoos and bird parks in countries including Belgium, the Netherlands, U.K., Poland, Austria, Luxembourg, France, Spain, the Czech Republic and Germany (S. G. Stadler in litt. 2007, 2012). Of 672 individuals listed in the studbook by December 2010, 102 were known to be alive (S. G. Stadler in litt. 2012). Since 2006, following an extensive survey of the origin of the founding individuals of the EEP population, major software-based population genetic analyses have been conducted and recommendations for new pairs have been given by the EEP coordinator (S. G. Stadler in litt. 2007, 2012). A special breeding unit for the species has been opened at Marlow Bird Park, Germany (Martínez-Gómez et al. 2003). A proposal has been developed to reintroduce the species (Baptista and Martínez-Gómez 1996, Martínez-Gómez et al. 2003, S. G. Stadler in litt. 2012), along with a restoration programme for Socorro (Martínez-Gómez et al. 2003, Horblit et al. 2006). DNA fingerprinting has revealed extensive hybridisation with Z. macroura in the U.S.A., however it also showed a high degree of relatedness between the European population and pure individuals kept in California (Martínez-Gómez et al. 2003). As a result, the European population will be used for reintroduction efforts. The construction of breeding aviaries on Socorro began in August 2003 (Martínez-Gómez et al. 2003) and was completed by 2005 (Bell et al. 2005a). Resident populations of Z. macroura and Common Ground-dove Columbina passerina (Bell et al. 2005a) were screened in December 2003 and January 2004 to assess the presence of pathogens that might affect the reintroduction programme (Martínez-Gómez et al. 2003, Bell et al. 2005a, b). Avian malaria and trichomoniasis were detected in both species, and as a result recommendations were put forward (Bell et al. 2005a, b). In 2005, plans were outlined to control the locust outbreaks, restore native vegetation and assess the problem of erosion (J. E. Martínez-Gómez in litt. 2005). The arrival on Socorro of the first birds from the EEP was planned for June 2005 (Bell et al. 2005b), with the establishment of a breeding flock by June 2006 (Bell et al. 2005a, S. G. Stadler in litt. 2012). However, there have been problems with import restrictions and permits (J. E. Martínez-Gómez in litt. 2007). In the face of these restrictions a small insurance population was established in the U.S.A. in 2008 (H. Horblit in litt. 2007, J. E. Martínez-Gómez in litt. 2007), forming the basis for the return of the species to Africam Safari Zoo, Puebla, Mexico (S. G. Stadler in litt. 2012). Two groups of birds were transferred to Mexico in 2013 and 2014 to form the basis of a population for eventual reintroduction to Socorro (J. E. Martínez-Gómez in litt. 2016). Control of feral cats has been undertaken on Socorro ( B. Tershy in litt. 1999) although despite over over five hundred cats being killed on the island between 2011-2016, they still persist throughout the island in low numbers (B. Tershy in litt. 2007, J. E. Martínez-Gómez in litt. 2016, Ortíz-Alcaraz et al. 2017, Lowen 2020). Furthermore, over 1,700 feral sheep were culled on the island between 2009-2012 (Ortíz-Alcaraz et al. 2016) and as of 2012, sheep were completely eradicated from the island, facilitating a rapid, remarkable recovery in local vegetation cover (Ortíz-Alcaraz et al. 2017, Lowen 2020). Reports that rats have recently colonised Socorro have proved to be unfounded (J. E. Martínez-Gómez in litt. 1999, 2000) although mice remain an issue on the island and must be removed due to their predation of dove chicks (J. Lowen in litt. 2020). Techniques to grow four endemic tree species from Socorro have been successful, with 117 tree seedlings planted on the island. These restored areas will be important when birds are eventually released back onto Socorro (J. E. Martínez-Gómez in litt. 2016). The species is included on the 'Watch List' of the State of North America's Birds as a species of high conservation concern (NABCI 2016).Conservation Actions ProposedImport birds from the EEP and establish a breeding flock on Socorro (Bell et al. 2005a, b, J. E. Martínez-Gómez in litt. 2007, S. G. Stadler in litt. 2012). Complete the eradication of cats and sheep on Socorro (J. E. Martínez-Gómez in litt. 2005, 2007). Continue to restore native vegetation on Socorro (J. E. Martínez-Gómez in litt. 2005). Reintroduce the species following satisfactory progress in mammal eradication (J. E. Martínez-Gómez in litt. 2005, 2007) and habitat restoration programmes (Martínez-Gómez et al. 2003, Horblit et al. 2006, J. E. Martínez-Gómez in litt. 2005).

Local knowledge from fishermen, fish vendors, and housewives further confirmed the disappearance of this species over the years from Lake Lanao. Therefore, this species is assessed as Extinct. The main driver of extinction was the predatory invasive alien species, Glossogobius giuris (Gobiidae). Another predatory introduced species, Giuris margaritaceus (Eleotridae), translocated accidentally in the lake probably in the early 1970s or much earlier, may have also contributed to its extinction. This species is now the most dominant fish throughout Lake Lanao. Without the eradication of this invasive species, this can push the remaining endemic cyprinids in the lake to extinction. Other significant threats that impacted the survival of this endemic species include overexploitation, rampant use of destructive fishing methods, and unsustainable fishing practices.",This lacustrine species most probably occupied the shallow shores of the lake (Herre 1926).,"The key driver of extinction was the introduction of predatory fish, mainly Glossogobius giuris (Gobiidae) which was accidentally translocated in Lake Lanao in the 1960s probably via stocking of aquaculture fish fry for fisheries enhancement in Lake Lanao (Sanguila et al. 1975, Juliano et al. 1989, Guerrero 2001, P.

Past and recent field sampling, market surveys, and fish landing monitoring conducted within the period 1976-2018 did not detect any individuals of this species. This indicates that the species has not been recorded from the lake for over 40 years. Recent key informant interviews with local fishermen, fish vendors, and housewives confirmed the disappearance or absence for decades of this species in Lake Lanao. The extinction of this species was mainly due to the introduction of predatory fish (Glossogobius giuris, a gobiid accidentally translocated in Lake Lanao in the early 1960s), overfishing, rampant use of destructive fishing methods, and unsustainable fishing practices. Giuris margaritaceus (Eleotridae), another unintentionally introduced fish in the lake in the 1970s, may have also contributed to its extinction. This species is now the most dominant fish throughout Lake Lanao.

It was last recorded in 1964. Its disappearance from the lake was corroborated by local fishermen, fish vendors, and housewives through key informant interviews. The extinction of this species is attributed mainly to the predatory introduced fish, Glossogobius giuris (Gobiidae). Other key threats that drive this species to extinction include overfishing, unsustainable fishing practices, and widespread use of destructive fishing methods. The abundance of another invasive alien species (Giuris margaritaceus) throughout the lake will push the remaining endemic species in the lake to extinction. Eradication of these invasive alien species in Lake Lanao should be immediately addressed.","A lacustrine species, probably occupying shallow areas like most species of endemic cyprinids in Lake Lanao.

It is accordingly considered Extinct. The last documented observation of this species was made in February 1995 in Morocco. The relative impact of threats that caused extinction are imperfectly understood, however habitat loss and hunting are thought to have been the main causes.","Behaviour: This species was migratory (del Hoyo et al. 1996). It was thought to breed in small colonies with nests between 2-3 m and 10-15 m apart (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Early records often referred to the species as occurring in large flocks on migration and in winter. However, the last records almost all involved individuals or small groups. The peak of the autumn migration appears to occur around September, with the spring migration peaking around March (Gretton 1991).Habitat: Breeding The only known nests were recorded in bog-forest transition zones (Gretton 1991) on the northern limit of the forest-steppe zone in habitat more typical of taiga marsh. This may represent either a very specialised breeding habitat requirement, or an unusual use of habitat at the limit of the species' breeding range (Gretton 1991). Non-breeding On migration and in winter, this species used a wide variety of habitats, including saltmarsh, wet grassland, steppe grassland, fishponds, saltpans, brackish lagoons, tidal mudflats, semi-desert, brackish wetlands and sandy farmland next to lagoons. Large coastal wetland complexes may have been especially characteristic, and most records come from close to the sea (Buchanan et al. 2010). When it wintered inland, it inhabited marsh areas fed with freshwater, but with areas of Salicornia indicating that the ground had a high salt content (Gretton 1991).Diet: There is little information on this species' diet: birds at Merja Zerga (Morocco) fed on earthworms and tipulid larvae, while elsewhere insects (there is a suspicion that orthoptera may have been an important food source [N. Crockford in litt. 2012]), molluscs and crustaceans were recorded as prey. Breeding site: A nest found by Ushakov in 1914 was constructed of dry grass with a few leaves of rush Scirpus but little or no sedge (Gretton 1991). The known nests were situated on dry areas of sedge and bog moss some distance from willow scrub or birch grove (Gretton 1991). An analysis of stable isotopes in feather samples from museum skins suggest that the main breeding area was located further south than the historically confirmed sites; in the steppes of northern Kazakhstan and southern central Russia between 48°N and 56°N, with a core area around 50°N (Buchanan et al. 2018).","While the threats that drove this species extinct will never perfectly be known, habitat loss and hunting were likely to have been the two main threats.On the species' probable breeding grounds (see Buchanan et al. 2018), extensive drainage and conversion of steppe to arable farming plausibly drove rapid declines (Buchanan et al. 2018, 2025). In the late 19th century and early to mid-20th century, these changes were particularly widespread (Belik 1994, Klein Goldewijk et al. 2011, Kraemer et al. 2015, Fluet-Chouinard et al. 2023) and were potentially exacerbated by heat-waves and droughts (Schubert et al. 2014). Similar threats are thought to have affected wintering and passage areas. The conversion of European wetlands and central European steppes to arable farmland may have heavily impacted the species by depriving it of important habitats during migration (Gretton 1991, Donald et al. 2010). For example, the Pannonian Plain, from which there are multiple records from multiple sites, has been almost entirely converted to agriculture (Gretton 1991, Buchanan et al. 2025). Gretton (1991) noted that the Evros Delta and Amvrakikos have been drained, while Merja Zerga (the last known wintering locality), in Morocco, stands out as one of the only wetlands in the Maghreb not to be converted to agriculture (Gretton 1991, Buchanan et al. 2025). Historically hunting pressure was high and may have been a significant factor in its decline (although this is difficult to prove), particularly once the population had already been depleted by other threats and habitat loss led to a concentration of birds at relatively few sites. Hunting parties were said to have shot multiple Slender-billed Curlews at Merja Zerga (Morocco) in the 1980s, at a time when the global population size was probably already small. The species was said to be tame (Gretton 1991) and its preference for suptratidal areas (which were also among the first affected by land-use change) probably made it particularly vulnerable to hunting (Buchanan et al. 2025). Some birds were found in food markets (Gretton 1991) and as the species became rarer, so the value of specimens increased (Gretton 1991, Nowak 1995, Buchanan et al. 2025). Following the initial decline, breakdown of social behaviour patterns may have prevented recovery. Historically a gregarious species, smaller groups or individuals may have had difficulty in locating suitable stop-over sites on migration (Gretton 1991).","There are reports that this species was locally quite common historically (Gretton 1991), however as early 1912 it was suggested that it was declining (Ushakov 1912) and a foreboding warning of its extinction was raised (but largely ignored/overlooked) in the 1940s (Stresemann and Grote 1943). By the time an action plan was published in 1996 (Gretton 1996), it was almost certainly too late. In total, 1,174 records were collated by Buchanan et al. (2025) spanning 1820 to 2011. The last specimen was collected in 1983; the most recent confirmed photograph (showing the identification criteria as outlined by Corso et al. 2014) was in Merja Zerga, Morocco, in 1995 (van den Berg 1995). All records since are unconfirmed, and most claims have proven to be Whimbrel N. phaeopus or Eurasian Curlew N. arquata. Despite considerable effort to search for the species (Gallo-Orsi and Boere 2001, Crockford and Buchanan 2017, Buchanan et al. 2025), no documented observations have been made for thirty years.Following methods developed in a series of papers published in 2017 (Akcakaya et al. 2017, Keith et al. 2017, Thompson et al. 2017), the probability that this species is extinct based on records and surveys is 0.994 (0.970-0.999), and the probability it is extinct based on threats is 0.926 (0.808-0.981) (analysis published by Buchanan et al. 2025). It is accordingly considered Extinct. An alternative, Bayesian modelling approach (Solow and Beet 2014: model 2; detailed in Carlson et al. 2018, Bond et al. 2019) also published by Buchanan et al. (2025) reached the same conclusion: 'The probability that the species remains extant in 2022 is less than 5 × 10−8'.","The breeding range of this species is not well understood. The only confirmed breeding was near Tara, north Omsk in Siberia, Russia, between 1909 and 1925 (Gretton et al. 2002). Recent stable isotope analysis (Buchanan et al. 2018) has suggested that the majority of the species' breeding range was however to the south of this, centred on the Kazakh Steppe mostly in Kazakhstan.The species' non-breeding range was evidently much more extensive (e.g. Gretton 1991, BirdLife International 1999, Kirwan et al. 2015, Buchanan et al. 2025), but a full elucidation is hampered by identification difficulties (see Corso et al. 2014, Kirwan et al. 2015). For example, most records for the Middle East should now be considered doubtful (Kirwan et al. 2015, R. Porter in litt. 2025), but most specimen or photographed records are from what is assumed to have been the main wintering area in the Mediterranean Basin (Gretton 1991, Kirwan et al. 2008, 2015, Buchanan et al. 2025). The last-known wintering site for the species was Merga Zerga, in western Morocco, where the last sighting was on 23 February 1995 (van den Berg 1995). There have been no verified sightings of the species since, and it is now thought to be extinct (Buchanan et al. 2025).","The degree to which hunting of this species was a factor in its extinction is not well known, but it is acknowledged by Buchanan et al. (2025) that hunting pressure on other species in the range of Slender-billed Curlew is generally high. Gretton (1991) noted that organised hunting trips to Merga Zerga in the 1980s, by which time the species was probably already rare, shot multiple Slender-billed Curlews. The species' preference for supratidal areas may have made it more accessible to hunters, and it apparently was tamer than other shorebirds (Gretton 1991, Buchanan et al. 2025). There are a number of records of skins being found in food markets (Gretton 1991) and skins of the species were increasingly sought by collectors as the species became rarer (Gretton 1991, Nowak 1995, Buchanan et al. 2025).",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,,Palearctic,Global

Multiple methods for determining the likelihood of extinction have used the sighting history of this species as a test dataset and each has determined that the species is extinct beyond reasonable doubt. The probability of the species being extinct from these models first exceeded 95% during the period between 1989 and the start of 2005. Separately, an expert-led assessment of the probability of extinction based on the severity and spatial extent of threats concluded there was 90% probability that it was extinct. Considering the last confirmed sighting of the species was in 1985 despite adequate survey of remaining habitat within the potential range, and in view of the threats to the species, its lack of mobility and restricted range, this species is considered to be Extinct.","Behaviour This species was presumed to be strongly sedentary since its small wings render it unable to fly long distances. Some movements to highland lakes and ponds other than Lake Alaotra were thought to have occurred as a result of the degradation of its preferred habitat, as opposed to representing habitual movement (del Hoyo et al. 1992). It was usually found in pairs, sometimes in association with T. ruficollis (Langrand 1990). It was thought to have a flexible breeding season, with historical records of breeding in April-June and in January-March (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Habitat Lake Alaotra is a large, shallow, brackish lake. Its shores were historically covered with dense vegetation including papyrus and reeds, which may have been important for this species (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Diet It fed almost exclusively on fish (Langrand 1990). Breeding site Nothing was known of its breeding ecology (Langrand 1990).","Several major factors contributed to this species' extinction. The primary driver of the rapid population reduction and loss of most individuals is considered to be the introduction of the carnivorous fish Micropterus salmoides and Channa striata (ZICOMA 1999), which caused adult mortality but more significantly reduced reproduction to near-zero. These fish were introduced to the Alaotra basin in the 1950s and very rapid population declines appear to have commenced shortly afterwards. Additional introductions of exotic plants, mammals and fish, especially Tilapia, probably depleted essential foods for the species (Pidgeon 1996). Conversion of natural habitat for agriculture also occurred at an increasing rate during this time, with deforestation resulting in sedimentation from soil erosion and water quality being lowered, and considerable area has been converted to rice farms (Wilmé 1994). The use of monofilament nylon gill-nets at Lake Alaotra proliferated more recently, to the extent that they now cover a large part of the open lake. They undoubtedly kill many diving waterbirds; however the introduction of this fishing method probably only happened after the grebe had already been greatly reduced in number or had disappeared (Hawkins et al. 2000). The final few individuals may have been lost through hybridisation with T. ruficollis, although this appears to have been occurring for a long time as the type series from 1932 includes a presumed hybrid (Delacour 1932, Collar and Stuart 1985, Hawkins et al. 2000). Poaching may also have played a role in the extinction of the species (Wilmé 1994), although larger-bodied waterbirds are thought to have always been the primary target of hunters (Hawkins et al. 2000).","The species was described in 1932 from Lake Alaotra (Delacour 1932) and in 1960 grebe flocks on the lake contained c. 50 individuals alongside Little Grebe T. ruficollis and Madagascar Little Grebe T. pelzelnii, but also a number of hybrids with T. ruficollis (Voous and Payne 1965, Collar and Stuart 1985). Thirteen specimens were collected at this time (Voous and Payne 1965), presumably out of the total of 50 (Hawkins et al. 2000). Numerous other reports from a wider area are given in Collar and Stuart (1985), but none were documented and were subsequently considered to be in error for T. pelzelnii. In 1982 c. 12 individuals were identified as still present, along with several hybrids (Hawkins et al. 2000). Two or three individuals were then recorded in 1985 near Andreba on Lake Alaotra, when the only known photographs of the species in the wild was taken (Hawkins et al. 2000, P. Thompson. in litt. 2022). There have been no further confirmed sightings despite considerable survey effort (Hawkins et al. 2000). The sighting series for the species has been used in the development of models to determine extinction probability using both linear modelling and Bayesian approaches (Lee et al. 2014, Thompson et al. 2017, 2019): these all conclude the species became extinct prior to 1995. Separately, an assessment of the likely impact of the combination of threats faced by the species concluded that the severity and extent indicated a 90% probability of extinction for the species (Keith et al. 2017).","Tachybaptus rufolavatus was endemic to Madagascar and known chiefly from Lake Alaotra (ZICOMA 1999). There have been no confirmed sightings since 1985 when two were seen (in addition to several apparent hybrids) near Andreba on Lake Alaotra in September 1985 (Hawkins et al. 2000, P. Thompson in litt. 2022). After this an adult and an immature were reported as the species in 1986 (B. Dawson, unpublished report) and two individuals (also an adult and an immature) which may have been Alaotra Grebe were again reported in 1988 (D. Thorn, unpublished report) but these were not documented and may have been hybrids (Hawkins et al. 2000). Survey visits to Lake Alaotra in 1989-90 (Young and Smith 1989, Wilmé 1994) 1993 and 1994 (Pidgeon 1996), then 1997-1999 failed to produce any sightings, prompting a targeted survey in 1999 which only located four T. pelzelnii (ZICOMA 1999, Hawkins et al. 2000). Visits in 2000 found no individuals (of this or any species of Tachybaptus) on Lake Alaotra or surrounding lakes, and further surveys drew blanks in 2004 and 2009 (H. G. Young in litt. 2009). Records outside the Lake Alaotra region were unreliable as species was probably incapable of prolonged flight, so in all likelihood never occurred very far from Lake Alaotra (ZICOMA 1999, Hawkins et al. 2000). Checks of additional potential sites, in particular Lake Amparihinandriamabavy (F. Hawkins in litt. 2009), have failed to find any grebes. It is now considered extinct, as no suitable wetlands remain unsurveyed in the Alaotra region (H. G. Young in litt. 2009).","Some deliberate take of the species for food has been reported (Wilmé 1994), although larger waterbirds were more likely targets than the much smaller bodied grebes (Hawkins et al. 2000).",Freshwater (=Inland waters),,Afrotropical,Global

Accordingly, it is classified as Extinct. Endemic to Maui, H. affinis was confined to the upper slopes of Haleakala. The last specimens were taken in 1896 by Perkins (in Banko 1984). Although Pratt and Pyle (2000) express some scepticism of the 20th century records, the USFWS (2023) consider the last genuine record to be in 1996 (Reynolds and Snetsinger 2001). Recent searches and extensive surveys for other species on Maui, have failed to locate it. It was driven to extinction by habitat loss and degradation, introduced rats, cats, pigs and other non-natives, and in particular as a result of avian malaria and avian pox viruses from introduced mosquitoes.","Hemignathus affinis inhabited dense, wet 'ohi'a forest and the higher parts of mesic koa-'ohi'a forest (Scott et al. 1986, Pratt et al. 1987). All recent reported sightings were between 1,450 and 2,000 m, mostly at the lower end of that range (Scott et al. 1986) although the most recent 1996 record was at 1,890 m. Foraging habits were similar to H. hanapepe in that it fed on wood-borers, spiders and beetles (Scott et al. 1986, Pratt et al. 1987, Conant et al. 1998, Reynolds et al. 1995). It hunted along the upper and lower surfaces of branches, both up and down the trunks (Perkins 1903) probing the bark on living and dead trees. It also gleaned caterpillars from the leaves of low trees (Munro 1960). According to Munro (1960), when feeding it would insert its longer, decurved, upper mandible into crevices and holes to hook out arthropods and then catch them with its tongue and lower mandible.","Since the arrival of humans in the Hawaiian Archipelago, Hawai’i’s forest birds have undergone tremendous losses and face a panoply of threats. At least 71 taxa of Hawaiian birds disappeared before the arrival of Captain James Cook in 1778, 24 more have been extirpated since (Banko and Banko 2009). With the arrival of the Polynesians between 1000 and 1200 CE, almost all lowland forests were felled and burned to make way for agriculture (Kirch 1982). This loss continued with the arrival of European and American settlers. Forests continued to be cleared until only high-elevation forest remained. Much of the forest that remains has been invaded by non-native species. Hawai’i has a long history of non-native species. The arrival of Polynesians brought pigs Sus scrofa, dogs Canis familiaris and Polynesian Rats Rattus exulans. With Europeans and Americans came Black R. rattus and Brown Rats R. norvegicus, cats Felis catus, mongoose Herpestes auropunctatus, feral goats Capra hircus, cattle Bos taurus, deer Axis axis, more than 50 species of birds (Atkinson and Lapointe 2009), plants, invertebrates, and diseases. Introduced ungulates have severely damaged forest structure through herbivory and the dispersal of invasive plants, rendering it far less suitable for H. affinis and other forest birds. Rats, cats and mongoose predate both nests and adult birds (Lindsey et al. 2009), while non-native birds may also compete with them for resources (Foster 2009). Non-native avian diseases introduced to Hawai'i are some of the most pervasive threats faced by native birds and are likely to be the main cause of many previous extinctions. Both avian malaria Plasmodium relictum and avian pox Avipoxvirus spp. are transmitted by the Southern House Mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus, currently climatically restricted to elevations below 1,500 m and responsible for the disappearance of many highly susceptible Hawaiian forest birds from elevations below this. Maui still retains some forest above 1,500 m, offering some refugia from these fatal diseases. However, the quality and intactness of this forest is less than pristine. Wallows created by feral pigs provide additional breeding habitats for Culex and allow it to infiltrate deeper into forests (Lapointe et al. 2009). As the climate warms the elevational limits of Culex will shift upslope and the area of suitable, mosquito-free forest will shrink even more (Atkinson and Lapointe 2009).The extinction of other Maui species such as Maui-nui Akialoa Akialoa lanaiensis, that occupied somewhat similar niches to H. affinis, suggest the threats posed by avian diseases, habitat loss and non-native species on Maui are severe enough to drive the species to extinction.","After no sightings for more than 60 years, Hemignathus affinis was rediscovered in 1967 (Banko 1968). There were then almost 30 subsequent claimed reports (with the last being made in 1996: Reynolds and Snetsinger 2001), however most, if not all, of these observations are thought to be misidentifications of Chlorodrepanis virens and possibly Pseudonestor xanthophrys (Pratt and Pyle 2000). However, a number of records have been by highly qualified observers and the last confirmed sighting is considered to be the 1996 record from Hanawi Natural Area Reserve (Reynolds and Snetsinger 2001, USFWS 2023). There have however been no claims made since and the species is widely considered extinct by multiple sources. Following methods developed in a series of papers published in 2017 (Akcakaya et al. 2017, Keith et al. 2017, Thompson et al. 2017), the probability that this species is extinct based on records and surveys is 0.91, and the probability it is extinct based on threats is 0.94. It is accordingly considered Extinct. In addition to the extinction probability assessment made here, the USFWS (2023) delisted H. affinis from the Federal Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants due to presumed extinction.","Hemignathus affinis was endemic to Maui in the Hawaiian Islands, U.S.A. It was found on the eastern and north-eastern slopes of Haleakala, in Hosmer's Grove and Waikamoi Preserve and from the Hanawi drainage east to Kipahulu Valley (Pratt and Pyle 2000). There have been no other confirmed sightings since 1996 despite extensive effort in a large proportion of the historic range, including annual surveys by the National Park Service (NPS), two State sanctioned surveys, monthly surveys in Hanawi, The Nature Conservancy (TNC) surveys and efforts by the Maui Forest Bird Recovery team. Although not all of these programmes surveyed locations where the species was last observed, many surveyed highly likely locations (Pratt and Pyle 2000, R. Camp in litt. 2003).","Historically Hawaiian honeycreepers were used extensively by indigenous people both for food and feathers (Amante-Helweg and Conant 2009). Feathers were used to manufacture numerous cultural artefacts such as mahiole (feathered helmets), 'ahu'ula (feathered capes), malo (loin cloths) and 'aumakua hulu manu (icons of royal battle gods) (Amante-Helweg and Conant 2009). Primarily, the red feathers of Iiwi Drepanis coccinea and the black and yellow feathers of Oo Moho spp. and Hawaii Mamo D. pacifica were used for these purposes. Despite its yellow feathers, there is no direct evidence to suggest that H. affinis was used to manufacture feathered objects, although it is plausible. Likewise, they plausibly may have been taken for food as other honeycreepers were (Amante-Helweg and Conant 2009). The use of Hawaiian honeycreepers for food and cultural artefacts has not occurred for a number of centuries (Amante-Helweg and Conant 2009).",Terrestrial,,Oceanian,Global

There has been extensive survey work for, and monitoring of, this species over recent decades which has documented a dramatic population decline from previously being common and widespread across Christmas Island. It was listed as Critically Endangered in 2006 after a decline in excess of 90% in three generations (12–15 years) based on an index of relative abundance from bat detectors, and subsequently by direct observation of the remaining individuals at a single roost. In January 2009, the total known adult population was four individuals and the estimated population was considered to be fewer than 20 individuals. By August 2009, only one remaining individual was found during an extensive survey, which was recorded consistently each day in its foraging and roosting areas. This individual disappeared on 27 August 2009 and no individuals have been located since, despite extensive searching using proven techniques. ","Pipistrellus murrayi roosted under bark, in dead foliage, and in tree hollows. Maternity roosts were discovered in late 2005 under shedding bark of dead forest trees (Tristiropsis acutangula and Inocarpus fagifer), many of which were heavily decayed and collapsed soon after (Lumsden et al. 2007). Females formed colonies of up to approximately 50 individuals, while males often roosted solitarily (Lumsden et al. 1999, 2007). Generation length of this species was likely to be 4-5 years. This species roosted in mature, tropical, evergreen, closed canopy rainforests and mature, tropical, semi-deciduous rainforests (Lumsden et al. 1999, James and Retallick 2007, Lumsden et al. 2007). It foraged in and over these forests and also along tracks, and in and over secondary forests and thickets of woody weeds (Lumsden et al. 1999, James and Retallick 2007, Lumsden et al. 2007). It fed on a range of small flying invertebrates, predominantly moths, beetles, and flying ants (Lumsden and Schulz 2009).","The reasons for the decline and ultimate extinction of P. murrayi remain unclear. While habitat loss may have caused some declines in the past, 75% of Christmas Island is covered by primary or secondary rainforest, with little change in the amount of available habitat during the period of decline. Furthermore, most of the species’ range was within a National Park. The major threats to the species may have included predation or disturbance to bats within their roosts from introduced species, e.g. Common Wolf Snake (Lycodon capucinus), Feral Cat (Felis catus), Black Rat (Rattus rattus) and Giant Centipede (Scolopendra subspinipes) (Lumsden et al. 2007). Although not considered the primary cause of decline, as the spatio-temporal pattern did not closely match the pipistrelle’s decline, a series of recent population explosions of Yellow Crazy Ants (Anoplolepis gracilipes) is likely to have led to some habitat change, likely decline in invertebrate prey resources, and may also have disturbed individuals at roost sites. It is also possible that some disease may have contributed to the decline, however, individuals captured over the period of decline appeared to be in good health, with the exception of low white blood cell counts, although the significance of these findings was unclear (Lumsden et al. 2007). Even the last known individual appeared to behave normally before it vanished.","Because Pipistrellus murrayi was the only echolocating bat on Christmas Island, ultrasonic bat detectors were an effective technique for documenting its status, as it was readily recorded and could not be confused with, or obscured by, other species. Intensive detector sampling over many years (intermittent between the mid-1990s and 2004, and then almost continuous until and after its extinction) has provided an unusually detailed documentation of its decline, resulting in it being one of the most intensely monitored bat species on the planet.Although there were no reliable population estimates, P. murrayi was reported to be abundant and widespread across Christmas Island at the time of its first settlement (1890s) (Andrews 1900), and was still abundant and widespread at the time of the first substantial study of it in 1984 (Tidemann 1985). By 1994 its range had contracted away from the north-east section of the island (which is where the only town is located), its distribution had become patchy, and it had started to decline in abundance (Lumsden and Cherry 1997). Between 1994 and 1998 there was a further westward range contraction and an apparent mean reduction of 33% in relative abundance, although this was not statistically significant (Lumsden et al. 1999, Schulz and Lumsden 2004). Between 1998 and 2004 there was a decline of between 55 and 65% in relative abundance and a continuing westward contraction of range of about 25 to 50% (James 2005). This decline continued and the species was then (ca 2007) considered to be confined to the far west of the island, no longer occurring across more than 90% of its former range (James and Retallick 2007, Lumsden et al. 2007). Long-term monitoring using bat detectors indicated this species underwent a 90% decline in abundance between 1994 and 2006 (James and Retallick 2007, Lumsden et al. 2007). This decline continued at a severe and consistent rate with the species disappearing from many of the few remaining sites where it was present in 2006 (Parks Australia North Christmas Island unpub. data).In December 2008, the remaining P. murrayi population was thought to be restricted to a single foraging area and a single roost area (Lumsden and Schulz 2009). Although the remaining single known roost site had previously contained as many as 50 individuals, by January 2009 there were only four adults present. The behaviour of these individuals suggested that they were lactating females with four dependent young in the roost. The total population was then estimated to be fewer than 20 individuals in order to account for the possibility of small undetected colonies (Lumsden and Schulz 2009). Lumsden and Schulz (2009) stated that the January findings indicated that without urgent intervention there was an extremely high risk that the species would become extinct in the near future. While it could not be precisely predicted when this would occur if there was no intervention, it was predicted that this could occur within the following six months.Unfortunately, this predicted extinction of the species was realised. After the January findings, approval was urgently sought to capture the remaining individuals for a captive breeding program, the details of which had been outlined in a feasibility report (Lumsden and Schulz 2009). Rather than acting immediately the Australian government established an Expert Working Group, and waited for its report in July 2009 (Beeton et al. 2009) before approving this intervention. In August 2009, a team of bat experts and captive breeding specialists attempted to take the remaining individuals into captivity. During the four weeks of intensive sampling, which employed 30 bat detectors each night to document the location of the remaining individuals, only one individual could be found, and despite extensive trapping efforts using standard and innovative techniques, it evaded all attempts to catch it (Lumsden 2009). On 27 August 2009 this individual also disappeared, and all survey and trapping attempts since that night have failed to detect the species. This is one of the few times that an extinction of a species in the wild can be marked to the day. The failure of the responsible agencies and managers to act quickly in response to the evidence of the rapid population decline is considered to have contributed to the extinction of this species (Lunney et al. 2011, Martin et al. 2012).","This species was endemic to Christmas Island (approximately 135 km² in area), Australia, which is in the eastern Indian Ocean. Although this bat was once widespread on the island, the last known individuals were recorded in the far western section of the island with no records from the rest of the island for a number of years.",,Terrestrial,"Pipistrellus murrayi is now extinct, as exhaustive surveys, using techniques that previously reliably detected the species, have been undertaken without success throughout its previously known range at appropriate times, habitat and locations, and over an appropriate time frame. A Recovery Plan for this species was prepared in 2004 (Schulz and Lumsden 2004). The plan’s implementation was reviewed by James and Retallick (2007), who considered that most actions had been implemented, although not sufficiently to determine the cause of the decline.",Indomalayan,Global

Extensive surveys have failed to find other tortoises on Pinta or in any of the world’s zoos. Tortoises with up to 50% abingdonii genes have been reported from Volcán Wolf on northern Isabela, including first generation hybrids, but no pure individuals of abingdonii are known to exist (TEWG, 2015). This assessment incorporates contributions from the international workshop on Galápagos tortoises convened by the Galápagos National Park Directorate in July 2012.","Chelonoidis abingdonii was a saddlebacked tortoise adapted for browsing on higher vegetation, in particular, low-hanging cactus pads. Pinta habitat, before its destruction by feral goats, was largely dry xeric brushland and grassland at lower elevations, with limited more mesic forest habitat at higher elevations. Opuntia cactus trees are dominant in much of the Arid and Transition Zones on the island and provide an important food resource for tortoises. Habitats are now recovering following goat eradication.","Chelonoidis abingdonii was heavily exploited by whalers and other mariners in the 19th century as on-board food supplies, which severely depleted the population. By the 20th century, few tortoises remained and some exploitation continued by local fishermen. In addition, extensive deforestation by goats, introduced to Pinta in 1959, destroyed tortoise habitat (Pritchard 1996).","Based on an estimated average density of one tortoise per hectare of suitable habitat, the pre-impact population was estimated to have been about 2,500 adults (Gibbs, unpubl. data). The Pinta Giant Tortoise was heavily exploited and its population collapsed in the middle of the 19th century, followed by significant collecting in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and exploitation by local fishermen subsequently. The last surviving animal, Lonesome George, was collected from the wild in 1972 and transferred to the Government of Ecuador’s Tortoise Centre on Santa Cruz, where he died on 24 June 2012. No further animals have been found on Pinta despite extensive surveys (Pritchard 1996). During the final goat eradication project (1998-2003), park ranger activity covered the island and yielded no sign of tortoises. In 2008, the Galápagos National Park Directorate carried out the last massive search for tortoises, but only found a few tortoise shells at the bottom of crevices (Cayot 2014).","Chelonoidis abingdonii occurred on Pinta [formerly Abingdon Island] in the Galápagos Islands of Ecuador. Pinta has a total surface area of 59.4 sq.km, of which 24.5 sq. km / 41% could potentially sustain tortoises (Gibbs, unpubl. data).",Chelonoidis abingdonii was historically exploited in the 19th century by whalers and other mariners as on-board food supplies.,Terrestrial,"Legislation and regulations: Chelonoidis abingdonii is protected under Ecuadorian national law.

The entirety of Pinta Island, and therefore 100% of this species’ native range, is protected as part of the Galapagos National Park.Captive breeding attempts with Lonesome George, the last known individual of C. abingdonii, were undertaken off and on during the 40 years of his residence at the Government of Ecuador’s Tortoise Centre on Santa Cruz, but he never reproduced. Goats were eradicated from Pinta in 1999 (Campbell et al. 2004). Ecosystem restoration on Pinta needs to continue to secure its other biodiversity. For that reason in May 2010, thirty-nine sterilized adult tortoises of various hybrid origins were released on to Pinta to act as non-reproductive natural ecosystem engineers to initiate a more natural habitat restoration process (Hunter et al. 2013). An ongoing project to remove hybrid tortoises with partial Pinta ancestry from Volcán Wolf on Isabela to begin a captive breeding programme is underway.

This was a crepuscular and partially nocturnal lizard (Vaillant 1882), which preyed on bird eggs and fledglings (Hazevoet 1994). Animals would also scavenge dead birds (Hazevoet 1994). Females laid two eggs per clutch (Andreone and Guarino 2003). It is hypothesized that sexual maturity was reached at five (males) or six (females) years of age (Andreone and Guarino 2003), but age estimation in these lizards is uncertain and maturity may have been reached later. Sexual dimorphism was most pronounced after eight years.","Rats, cats and dogs have all been introduced to Santa Luzia, where they represented the major predators of this lizard (Andreone and Guarino 2003). As well as directly preying on the skink, rats and cats competed with them for food and may have caused declines in the seabird colonies on which this lizard relies. Particularly in times of drought, humans have also used the skink as a food source (Schleich 1982), for medicine and skins (Bocage 1873), and commercial trade for scientific purposes (Andreone and Guarino 2003). Low population numbers and recruitment, slow growth rates (Andreone and Guarino 2003), and a restricted range on a single island and two smaller islets all put this skink at extremely high risk from these threatening processes, as well as from stochastic events (particularly droughts, thought likely to have contributed to the species' extinction - Andreone 2000), and it is now thought to be extinct.","This species was last seen alive in 1912, and has been considered extinct by some authors (e.g. Andreone and Guarino 2003) and in the First Red List of Cape Verde (Schleich 1996). A recent five-day survey of Santa Luzia failed to recover evidence of a surviving population (Miralles et al. 2011, Vasconcelos et al. 2013), and these authors likewise concluded that this skink is now extinct. The most recent record of this species was a mandible of a juvenile collected from cat faeces on Santa Luzia in 2005, since when the cat population has increased and the invasive animals are now widespread on the island (R. Vasconcelos pers. obs.). Repeated surveys of Branco and Raso since this species was last recorded have also failed to rediscover it.","This species was endemic to the Cape Verde islands, where it had been recorded from the islets Branco and Raso (Schleich 1987, Bocage 1873). These islands have a combined area less than 10.7 km². Its area of occupancy would have been an estimated 7 km² (Vasconcelos et al. 2013). It appears to have historically been more widespread on the islands (Bocage 1873), with subfossils reported from São Vicente and Santa Luzia (Mateo et al. 1997). It may also have occurred on São Nicolau, based on the reports of local fishermen, but evidence for this is lacking (Miralles et al. 2011). Mateo et al. (2005) reported finding partial remains of a juvenile in cat faeces on Santa Luzia, but a five-day survey of this island in 2006 failed to record the species (Miralles et al. 2011, Vasconcelos et al. 2013). Additional subfossil remains have been found near a beach on this island (R. Vasconcelos pers. comm. 2012).","Use of this species has been reported for local subsistence hunting, for medicine (as a traditional painkiller - Bocage 1873), and for the international pet trade.

The species has not not been observed in the wild since the early 20th century and no ex situ subpopulations exist. The species is therefore assessed as Extinct.","Lake Zug is a meromictic, perialpine, naturally oligotrophic lake formed after the last glacial period. It has a maximum depth of 197 metres, and is subdivided by a peninsula into a deep southern basin with steep slopes and a shallower northern basin.Three whitefish species which differed in traits related to feeding and reproductive ecology along depth gradients were formerly endemic to the lake, two of which are now extinct.The Obliterated Whitefish is understood to have been a profundal specialist feeding on benthic prey.The annual reproductive period probably extended from mid-September to mid-October, and spawning took place in the deeper parts of the lake.","Discharge of urban waste water and agricultural runoff into its tributary rivers caused Lake Zug to become increasingly eutrophic from the early 19th century onwards, and by the early 1980s it was among the most polluted lakes in Switzerland.These conditions are believed to have driven the extinction of the Obliterated Whitefish and Zug Whitefish (Coregonus zugensis) due to depletion of oxygen in the water column below c. 100 metres depth, leading to their profundal spawning sites becoming inaccessible.The Enduring Whitefish (Coregonus supersum) is the only endemic congener that remains extant in the lake, and is likely to have survived because it is able to complete its life cycle in comparatively shallow water.A secondary outcome of such changes in the available range of spawning depths is the potential for overlap and increased gene flow between different whitefish species that were formerly segregated along depth gradients. This raises the possibility of speciation reversal and extinction events due to hybridisation and introgression, which have been observed in some other Swiss lakes but not yet studied in Lake Zug.","Fisheries records suggest that this species was declining by the 1870s, and became extinct prior to 1950.","This species was endemic to Lake Zug (fr.

This species has not been recorded with certainty on Kaua'i since 1989 nor on Hawai'i since 1987, and recent searches specifically for it, alongside extensive surveys for other species on both Kaua'i and Hawai'i, have failed to locate it. It was driven to extinction by habitat loss and degradation, introduced rats, cats, pigs and other non-natives, and in particular as a result of avian malaria and avian pox viruses from introduced mosquitoes.","It was restricted to wet to mesic 'ohi'a forest between 800 and 1,900 m, mainly 1,200-1,500 m (Scott et al. 1986, Snetsinger et al. 1998), though historically range expanded into low-elevation forest (Snetsinger et al. 2020). Its bill was adapted to feeding on 'ie'ie Freycinetia arborea, an understory vine, and outside the 'ie'ie fruiting season, it was nomadic in response to seasonal fruit and invertebrate abundance (Snetsinger et al. 1998).","Since the arrival of humans in the Hawaiian Archipelago, Hawai’i’s forest birds have undergone tremendous losses and face a panoply of threats, primarily; habitat loss and degradation; avian disease; and predation and competition from non-native species. At least 71 taxa of Hawaiian birds had disappeared before the arrival of Captain James Cook in 1778; 24 more have been extirpated since (Banko and Banko 2009a).With the arrival of the Polynesians between 1000 and 1200 CE, almost all lowland forests were felled and burned to make way for agriculture (Kirch 1982). This loss continued with the arrival of European and American settlers. Forests continued to be cleared until only high-elevation forest remained. Much of the forest that remains has been invaded by non-native species.Hawai'i has a long history of non-native species. When the Polynesians arrived, they brought with them pigs Sus scrofa, dogs Canis familiaris and Polynesian Rats Rattus exulans. With the Europeans and Americans came Black R. rattus and Brown Rats R. norvegicus, cats Felis catus, mongoose Herpestes auropunctatus, feral goats Capra hircus, cattle Bos taurus, deer Axis axis, more than 50 species of birds (Atkinson and Lapointe 2009), plants, invertebrates, and diseases. Introduced ungulates have altered forest structure through herbivory and the dispersal of invasive plants, rendering it far less suitable for Ou and other forest birds. Rats, cats and mongoose predate both nests and adult birds (Lindsey et al. 2009). Rats also compete with Ou for their primary food source, ‘ie‘ie vine Freycinetia arborea (Banko and Banko 2009b), while non-native birds may also compete with them for resources (Foster 2009).Non-native avian diseases introduced to Hawai'i are some of the most pervasive threats faced by native birds and are likely to be the main cause of many previous extinctions. Both avian malaria Plasmodium relictum and avian pox Avipoxvirus spp. are transmitted by the Southern House Mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus, currently climatically restricted to elevations below 1,500 m and responsible for the disappearance of many highly susceptible Hawaiian forest birds from elevations below this. The islands of Kaua'i, O'ahu, Moloka'i, and Lānaʻi have no forest above 1500m and therefore offer no refugia from these fatal diseases. Little forest remains above this elevation on Hawai'i and Maui and as the climate warms the elevational range of Culex will increase (Atkinson and Lapointe 2009). Wallows created by feral pigs provide additional breeding habitats for Culex and allow it to infiltrate deeper into forests (Lapointe et al. 2009). By the time avian malaria was thought to have taken hold on Kaua'i in the 1950s Ou were already uncommon and lost from low elevations, suggesting disease is not solely responsible and forest clearance and invasive species also bear considerable responsibility for its decline (L. Crampton in litt. 2023).For species with already small population sizes, natural disasters can be catastrophic. In 1984 thousands of acres of forest, in one of the species' last strongholds, the Upper Waiākea Forest Reserve, were engulfed by the kilometre-wide lava flow (Reynolds and Snetsinger 2001). In 1982 and 1992 Hurricanes ‘Iwa and ‘Iniki battered the Alaka'i swamp, the last known range of Ou on Kaua'i, and had devastating effects on the native forest. Three species of bird, including Ou, have not been seen on Kaua'i since these hurricanes (USFWS 2022).","There have been unconfirmed reports of Ou up to 1996, but no confirmed records since 1989. Following methods developed in a series of papers published in 2017 (Akcakaya et al. 2017, Keith et al. 2017, Thompson et al. 2017), the probability that this species is extinct based on records and surveys is 0.984, and the probability it is extinct based on threats is 0.941. It is accordingly considered Extinct and the population size is set to 0 mature individuals. Historically Ou were widespread across much of the Hawaiian Archipelago, but were extirpated from O'ahu, Maui, Moloka'i and then Lana'i between 1899 and 1931 (Pyle and Pyle 2017). The last confirmed record on Hawai'i was in 1987 (Snetsinger et al. 1998) while the last confirmed record on Kauai was 1989 (Pyle 1986).","Psittirostra psittacea was originally widespread in the Hawaiian Islands (USA), but was extirpated from O'ahu, Maui, Moloka'i and then Lana'i between 1899 and 1931 (Snetsinger et al. 1998). On Kaua'i, it survived in the Alaka'i Wilderness Preserve into the mid-1970s, with c. 62 birds being present during 1968-1973 (USFWS 1983), but only a few in 1981 (Scott et al. 1986), two in 1989 and none since. On Hawai'i, several populations were present in the early 1980s, with c.394 estimated during 1976-1983 (Scott et al. 1986) but, in 1984, a lava-flow from Mauna Loa passed through the Upper Waiakea Forest Reserve, the species' stronghold (Scott et al. 1986, Snetsinger et al. 1998). In 1982 and 1992 Hurricanes ‘Iwa and ‘Iniki battered the Alaka'i swamp, the last known range of Ou on Kaua'i, and had devastating effects on the native forest. Three species of bird, including Ou, were not seen on Kaua'i since these hurricanes (USFWS 2022). However, there have been unconfirmed reports from Koai'e Stream, Alaka'i (Kaua'i) and Pu'u Maka'ala Natural Area Reserve and Kapapala-Ka'u Forest Reserve (Hawai'i) up to 1996 (Snetsinger et al. 1998, J.

Accordingly, it is classified as Extinct. ","While the most recent records were all in rainforest and only a few in weedy forest (Higgins et al. 2006), they were historically recorded nesting in orchards (Hull 1910) and red guava Pisidium cattleianum trees and feeding on fruits of olives Olea europaea (Mees 1969) and insects (Christian 2005).","Threats for this species have operated at an acuity and spatial scale that have driven it extinct. Following methods developed in a series of papers published in 2017 (Akcakaya et al. 2017, Keith et al. 2017, Thompson et al. 2017), the probability it is extant based on threats is 0.02 (Clarke et al. 2021). The principal threat was predation by black rats Rattus rattus which are thought to have been introduced in the mid-1940s (Robinson 1988). Most other Zosterops species persist alongside rats, including two other species on Norfolk Island, but rats appear to have exterminated the Robust White-eye Z. strenuus within ten years of colonising Lord Howe Island (Hindwood 1940, Sharland 1929). The effects of predation have been exacerbated by the clearance of much native forest and invasion of the remainder by exotic weeds. Although being baited on the ground in the National Park since the early 1990s, rats have remained common in trees and shrubs and their arboreal behaviour renders such control programs less effective (Nance et al. 2023b). Loss of good habitat to agriculture, predation by cats Felis catus and competition from the self-introduced Silvereye Zosterops lateralis, first recorded on the island in 1904, may have contributed to the white-eye’s decline but are unlikely to be primary causes (Clarke et al. 2021).","While common and widespread in 1908 (Hull 1910) and 1926 (Mees 1969), it was very scarce in 1962, with a population estimated at &lt;50 birds, and only two birds were seen in 1968 (Mees 1969). Four records during an island-wide survey in 1979 were the last multi-observer records (Schodde et al. 1983). Formal searches in the 1980s and in 2009 (Dutson 2013) failed to find the species, but poorly documented reports (detailed in Dutson 2013) suggested persistence. There have been no records since 2009 and from 2017 to 2019 postgraduate students spending three months a year working in prime white-eye habitat on the island and have seen none (R. Clarke unpublished, in Clarke et al. 2021). Intensive nest searches over three breeding seasons in 2018–2020 during peak breeding months and an island-wide point-count survey between October and November 2019 also failed to detect the species (Nance et al. 2023a).Following methods developed in a series of papers published in 2017 (Akcakaya et al. 2017, Keith et al. 2017, Thompson et al. 2017), the probability that this species is extinct based on records and surveys is 0.99, and the probability it is extinct based on threats is 0.98 (Clarke et al. 2021).

Since its ‘rediscovery’ in 1960 (Richardson and Bowles 1964) there were at least 30 reports, the most recent of which was in 2007 (Pratt 2010). There have been no records since, despite extensive searches. Following methods developed in a series of papers published in 2017 (Akcakaya et al. 2017, Keith et al. 2017, Thompson et al. 2017), the probability that the species is extinct based on records and surveys is 0.92, and the probability it is extinct based on threats is 0.97. Accordingly, it is classified as Extinct. ","This species inhabited dense, wet 'ohi'a forest and the higher parts of mesic koa-'ohi'a forest (Scott et al. 1986, Pratt et al. 1987), where it fed on wood-borers, spiders and beetles (Scott et al. 1986, Conant et al. 1998). It hunted along the upper and lower surfaces of branches, both up and down the trunks (Perkins 1903) probing the bark on living and dead trees. It also gleaned caterpillars from the leaves of low trees (Munro 1960). According to Munro (1960), when feeding it would insert its longer, decurved, upper mandible into crevices and holes to hook out arthropods and then catch them with its tongue and lower mandible. The Koa'e Valley in the Alaka'i Wilderness Preserve (where it was potentially seen in 1995 [Conant et al. 1998]) is at 1,000-1,300 m (Pratt 1994), although it was previously seen as low as 600m (Perkins 1903).","Since the arrival of humans in the Hawaiian Archipelago, Hawai’i’s forest birds have undergone tremendous losses and face a panoply of threats. At least 71 taxa of Hawaiian birds disappeared before the arrival of Captain James Cook in 1778, 24 more have been extirpated since (Banko and Banko 2009). With the arrival of the Polynesians between 1000 and 1200 CE, almost all lowland forests were felled and burned to make way for agriculture (Kirch 1982). This loss continued with the arrival of European and American settlers. Forests continued to be cleared until only high-elevation forest remained. Much of the forest that remains has been invaded by non-native species. Hawai’i has a long history of non-native species. When the Polynesians arrived, they brought with them pigs Sus scrofa, dogs Canis familiaris and Polynesian Rats Rattus exulans. With the Europeans and Americans came Black R. rattus and Brown Rats R. norvegicus, cats Felis catus, mongoose Herpestes auropunctatus, feral goats Capra hircus, cattle Bos taurus, deer Axis axis, more than 50 species of birds (Atkinson and Lapointe 2009), plants, invertebrates, and diseases. Introduced ungulates have severely damaged forest structure through herbivory and the dispersal of invasive plants, rendering it far less suitable for Kauai Nukupuu and other forest birds. Rats, cats and mongoose predate both nests and adult birds (Lindsey et al. 2009), while non-native birds may also compete with them for resources (Foster 2009). Non-native avian diseases introduced to Hawai'i are some of the most pervasive threats faced by native birds and are likely to be the main cause of many previous extinctions. Both avian malaria Plasmodium relictum and avian pox Avipoxvirus spp. are transmitted by the Southern House Mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus, currently climatically restricted to elevations below 1,500 m and responsible for the disappearance of many highly susceptible Hawaiian forest birds from elevations below this. Kaua'i has no forest above 1,500 m and therefore offers no refugia from these fatal diseases. Wallows created by feral pigs provide additional breeding habitats for Culex and allow it to infiltrate deeper into forests (Lapointe et al. 2009).","Many consider the last confirmed record of H. hanapepe to have been two specimens taken in 1899 (Pratt and Pyle 2000, Pyle and Pyle 2017, USFWS 2022). Despite there being at least 30 subsequent sightings since 1960, the most recent of which was in 2007 (Pratt 2010), it has been argued that none are accompanied by sufficient evidence to eliminate possible confusion with Chlorodrepanis stejnegeri (Pratt and Pyle 2000).

It is accordingly considered Extinct with a population size of 0. The species is likely to have always been rare: early collectors noted that it was rare or uncommon (Pyle and Pyle 2017) and there was a large gap in records between 1899 and its apparent 'rediscovery' (although see above) in 1960 (Richardson and Bowles 1964). In addition to the extinction probability assessment made here, the USFWS (2023) delisted H. hanapepe from the Federal Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants due to presumed extinction, which they believe occurred in the early 20th century.","Hemignathus hanapepe was endemic to Kaua'i in the Hawaiian Islands, U.S.A., where the last confirmed record was two specimens taken in 1899 (Munro 1960). It probably became confined to the Alaka'i Wilderness Preserve (Scott et al. 1986, Conant et al. 1998) and since its 'rediscovery' in 1960 (Richardson and Bowles 1964) it has been reported there at least 30 times.

Visual confirmation of records is required due to potential confusion with, or mimicry by, Pseudonestor xanthophrys (Reynolds and Snetsinger 2001). L. ochraceus were described as locally abundant in 1894 (Perkins 1903) and a flock of more than 100 in 1961 led Bole (1961) to conclude they were not rare on Maui.In addition to the extinction probability analysis used here, the USFWS (2023) has now delisted L. ochraceus from the Federal Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants due to presumed extinction.","Loxops ochraceus was endemic to Maui, Hawaiian Islands, U.S.A.

Tindale (1933) recorded the burning of the stick-nest rats’ nest and the capture of the fleeing inhabitants on his ‘Mann Ranges 1933’ black-and-white film (copies held by the South Australian Museum and by the University of Adelaide). There have been unconfirmed reports since, including one from 1970, and occasional reports of fresh vegetation being added to old stick-nests, but there is little doubt that the species is Extinct.","Stick-nest Rats constructed large nests of sticks and sometimes stones, depending on available construction materials. Some remaining in caves in breakaways in the Gibson Desert and near the Finke stock route in the southern Northern Territory are more than 3 m by 2 m by 1 m high. Stick nests were also built in wooded country well away from ranges, but most have not survived (Burbidge and Fuller 1979, Copley 1999, see Tindale 1933 for black and white film when the last two specimens were collected). There are also historic records of it sheltering in tree hollows (Robinson 2023).The diet was mainly vegetarian, including leaves of chenopods, other semi-succulent shrubs, seeds and grasses, but also included invertebrates such as beetles and termites (Copley 1999, McDowell et al. 2012). The different food preferences (if not habitat preferences) between the two species of stick-nest rats are reflected in their molar teeth. Although both have incisors that are similar in being relatively narrow and fairly lightly built, their molars are very different. Those of  the Lesser Stick-nest Rat are fairly low-crowned, with quite sloping cusps and with the lophs in the lower molars forming a characteristic chevron pattern, all suggesting that the species fed on relatively high quality food, such as sandalwood nuts (whose shells are usually found in quite large numbers in their stick-nests). In contrast, the molars of the Greater Stick-nest Rat Leporillus conditor are very high-crowned, with almost vertical cusps, suggesting that they fed on larger volumes of lower quality vegetation, such as saltbush, which was fairly abrasive, because old individuals in owl pellet accumulations have quite worn-down teeth (A. Baynes pers. comm. 2011).The construction of stick-nests shows that shelter was important; the nests probably provided an ameliorated microclimate and some protection from predators. The species was social, with nests sheltering several individuals, with records of up to ten in a nest (Robinson 2023).Radiocarbon dates of stick-nest rat nest-middens have revealed dates ranging from modern to 10,900 ± 90 BP (Pearson et al. 1999). Pearson and Dodson (1991), Pearson (1999) and Webeck and Pearson (2005) have studied Stick-nest Rat middens to document past changes in vegetation and climate in central Australia, while Pearson et al. (2001) have documented animal remains in the nest-middens.","Predation by feral cats Felis catus is likely to have been the main cause of extinction. Cats had colonised the whole of Australia by the 1890s (Abbott 2002, 2008). The arrival of Red Foxes Vulpes vulpes in its range may have driven remnant subpopulations to extinction; high rabbit numbers led to high fox numbers. Habitat degradation, particularly in refuges during drought, caused by introduced herbivores (mainly rabbits and sheep) before and leading into severe drought conditions may have contributed to extinction. Morton (1990) and Copley (1999) have discussed the effects of introduced herbivores on this and other extinct mammals; Tunbridge (1991) described effects of sheep at the Flinders Ranges. Predation by indigenous predators, such as Dingoes and owls, in combination with habitat degradation by introduced herbivores was probably a minor threat on its own but possibly an enhanced threat when other threats were operating.","Krefft (1866) reported Lesser Stick-nest Rats ‘in great numbers … on both sides of the Murray River’, i.e., New South Wales and Victoria). Many early explorers commented on the abundance and large size of stick-nests, including in northern areas where only this species of Leporillus has been recorded (Copley 1999). However, by the early 20th century, explorers and naturalists reported that it was rare. Western desert Aboriginal people reported that it disappeared at least 40 to 50 years prior to the mid-1980s (Burbidge et al. 1988). The decline happened from east to west and from south to north (Copley 1999). It is now extinct.The date this species was last seen in the wild may have been as late as the 1970s, as a large rodent that was captured and released in 1970 in a cave west of the Canning Stock Route, Western Australia, may have been this species (Robinson and Burbidge 2008). Information from the aboriginal population suggest this species persisted up to about 1950 (Robinson 2023).","Collation of available records from a variety of sources (Copley 1999), including the remains of stick nests and subfossil data (e.g., Watts and Eves 1976, Baynes and Johnson 1996, summarised in Copley 1999 and Burbidge et al. 2009) shows that the Lesser Stick-nest Rat formerly ranged though semi-arid and arid Western Australia, South Australia, the Northern Territory, New South Wales and the far northwest of Victoria, although the distribution was probably patchy and dependent on there being suitable vegetation for food.The distribution of stick-nest rats formed arcs along the southeastern, southern and southwestern boundaries of the arid zone, from western Victoria to North West Cape in Western Australia.  The Lesser Stick-nest Rat occurred further inland from the arid zone boundary, reaching the MacDonnell Ranges and Uluru (Baynes and Baird 1992) and occurring in the Great Victoria and Gibson Deserts, but also extended further southwest, to Peak Charles and probably parts of the Western Australian wheatbelt (A.

A recent analysis estimated that there was a 92% likelihood, albeit with very broad 95% confidence intervals from 39.18–99.99%, that the species is extinct based on the Records and Surveys model; and analysis using the Threats model concluded that there was a 98% (range 85.5–100) likelihood it is extinct (see Supplementary Information for details). These estimates exceed the 90% likelihood of extinction [P(E)] recommended underpinning a categorisation as Extinct. On the balance of evidence, this species is therefore assessed as Extinct.","The most recent records were from tall rainforest with deep soils, and terrace rainforest with shallow soils (Schulz 2002). It was recorded using holes in rocks and roots of trees as shelter and foraging predominantly on small beetles (Andrews 1900).","The most marked population decline occurred between 1900 and 1909, most likely due to the same disease (trypanosomisis), associated with the introduction of black rats Rattus rattus in 1900 (Green 2014), that caused the extinction then of Christmas Island's two endemic rat species. Schulz (2002) listed the following potential threats in the previous Recovery Plan for this species: disease; the introduced yellow crazy ant (Anoplolepis gracilipes) which is a threat for many terrestrial animals on Christmas Island; habitat loss; habitat alteration (in part through the spread of invasive weeds); predation by both introduced and natural predators (including cats and black rats); small population size; and mortality due to road traffic. The introduction of the common wolf snake Lycodon capucinus in the 1980s may have further contributed to its decline, given that this snake quickly spread across the entire island, attained high densities, and was probably the causal factor in the extinction of two endemic reptile species (Emery et al. 2021) and the endemic insectivorous bat (Woinarski 2018).","The Christmas Island shrew is likely to be Extinct. It was reported to be 'extremely common' at the time of the first zoological survey of the island in 1898 (Andrews 1900) but its population then declined rapidly and it was considered probably extinct by the time of the next survey in 1908 (Andrews 1909). Since 1898 there have been only four confirmed records: two individuals in 1958, and two individuals in 1985. Several unconfirmed reports occurred between 1996 and 1998 but a survey undertaken in 2000 to determine the status of the shrew failed to find any individuals (Meek 2000), and substantial survey effort since then has failed to record the species (Eldridge et al. 2014, Woinarski et al. 2014, Woinarski et al. 2023).

The last individual was recorded in 2009. The species is listed as Extinct, because targeted searching in 2011 and 2014 failed to report it and suitable habitat is no longer found on the small cay.","The Bramble Cay Melomys was nocturnal. It lived amongst the vegetation on the cay and used burrows as refuges (Latch 2008, Dennis 2012). It was restricted to the 4 ha Bramble Cay, but the vegetation cover (and hence food resources) on this island declined to almost complete absence by 2014 (Woinarski et al. 2014, Waller et al. 2017).","This species was never subject to detailed study. The first substantial report on its status in 1983 considered that its population was at least several hundred individuals (Limpus et al. 1983). It declined either gradually or episodically subsequently, although there were few and not very robust estimates of its status. It is likely that decline occurred due directly to storm surges across the entire island (killing individuals) and causing ongoing and episodic reduction in vegetation, with such increases in extent and frequency of inundation likely due to rising sea levels associated with global climate change (Woinarski et al. 2014, Waller et al. 2017).","Limpus et al. (1983) estimated the total population size in 1978 as ‘several hundred individuals’. In 1998, the population size was estimated as about 90 individuals, based on 42 captures (Dennis and Storch 1998); subsequent trapping studies using the same methodology in 2002 and 2004 yielded only 10 and 12 individuals (Dennis 2012). The last individual was reported in 2009 (Waller et al. 2017; Dennis and Waller 2023). Targeted and comprehensive searches in December 2011, March 2014 and August-September 2014 failed to record the species and also reported that almost all vegetation (and hence food resources) had been lost from the cay (Waller et al. 2017, Dennis and Waller 2023).","This species was endemic to Bramble Cay, a small (4 ha) coral cay in Torres Strait, Australia (Latch 2008, Dennis 2012, Woinarski et al. 2014).

Despite numerous reports of sightings since then including on mainland Australia (Heberle 2004), and many organised searches in Tasmania by government agencies, conservation NGOs, philanthropists, and others (more search effort than any other extinct mammal (Fisher and Blomberg 2011)), there has been no convincing evidence of its persistence. Brook et al. (2023) used uncertainty modelling of purported sightings to map a regional extirpation pattern, and concluded that it probably persisted until the 1980s, however Mooney (2023) concluded that no sightings since 1936 can be substantiated. All data sets analysed with a conservative probabilistic sighting-record resampling by Brook et al. (2023) concluded that the Thylacine has 100% probability of being extinct in 2023. The statistical approaches of Brook et al. (2023), Carlson et al. (2018) and Fisher &amp; Blomberg (2011, 2012) are robust probabilistic extinction models using sighting data that included uncertainty of records, distribution variables, search effort, and other trait data. There have been at least six classes of quantitative models applied to estimate the probability of extinction and the date of extinction of the thylacine in the peer-reviewed scientific literature (Fisher and Humphries 2024). 1) Stationary Poisson (Solow 1993), 2) Weibull model / Optimal linear estimation (Roberts and Solow 2003), 3) Nonparametric (Solow and Smith 2005), 4) Cox Regression Survival model of threat and effort (Fisher and Blomberg 2012), 5) Bayesian Stationary Poisson model with varying certainty of sightings and independent processes for valid and invalid sightings (Solow and Beet 2014, Carlson et al. 2018), 6) Stationary Poisson with resampling (Brook et al. 2019, Brook et al. 2023). These have used a range of assumptions about the data distribution and certainty, both frequentist and Bayesian approaches, and sets of different sources of data including sighting dates, species traits, measures of effort, distributional data, and observer reliability. Virtually all have concluded that the Thylacine is extinct, and nearly all (and all with physical evidence) have concluded that the extinction date was in the 1930s or 1940s. Additionally, from 2014 to 2020, 3,225 camera trap sites throughout Tasmania leading to photographs on &gt;315,000 camera nights revealed no detections of anything that could be attributed to a Thylacine (C.N. Johnson pers. comm.).","Thylacines occurred in most habitats in Tasmania, but apparently not the dense temperate rainforests of the south-west (Paddle 2000). The skull of the Thylacine is highly convergent with the wolf suggesting similar dietary ecology (Newton 2021), although it probably had a less powerful bite than a wolf (Mooney and Rounsevell 2023). It was likely an endurance runner ('coursing predator') that hunted and scavenged mainly at night, singly or in pairs. Before it was widely persecuted, diurnal observations were also reported (Mooney and Rounsevell 2023). Its main food items were reported to be kangaroos and wallabies. Dens were often located among rocks and in caves, Paddle (1993) describes a 1903 photograph of a den in a shallow cave containing nesting material of ferns. Litters (of up to four young, usually two or three) were also discovered amongst dense vegetation.","There was extensive persecution of the Thylacine because of a perceived threat to sheep, and fear of a large predator (Mooney and Rounsevell 2023). From 1830 (less than three decades after Europeans arrived in Tasmania), companies and individual landowners began offering bounty payments (Mooney and Rounsevell 2023). Its eradication was funded by a Tasmanian government scheme from 1888 to 1909, and a bounty was paid for more than 2,200 Thylacines killed (Heberle et al. 2004, Sleightholme and Campbell 2016). This is a similar number to the estimated Thylacine population of Tasmania at any one time (Mooney and Rounsevell 2023). Collecting by museums and zoos was also a major reason for hunting in the early 20th century. A disease similar to canine distemper could have contributed to extinction (Paddle 2012). However single-species population viability analysis models are unable to account for extinction unless a high human harvest, small starting population size or low maximum population growth rate is assumed, even if disease effects are included from 1906 to 1909. Thylacine extinction in Tasmania is readily recreated using disease-free multi-species models that simulate declines in native prey populations (particularly due to competition with introduced sheep) (Prowse et al. 2013).",This species is presumed to be extinct.,"The Thylacine was once found on the island of New Guinea and was widespread on the Australian mainland, but disappeared from everywhere except Tasmania by at least 2000 years ago, probably because of predation by and competition from the Dingo Canis lupus (Johnson 2006). In modern times it was known only in Tasmania, which was isolated from the Australian mainland c. 8,000 – 10,000 years ago, before the arrival of the Dingo on the mainland. It was widespread in Tasmania, but most abundant in open forest and woodland (Guiler 1985, Paddle 2000). It occurred in most habitat types from low (east) to high (north-west) rainfall but at low densities in the south-west where rainfall is very high, soil fertility is very low, and vegetation is hummock grassland (button grass), wet scrub, or wet forest.",,Terrestrial,"In 1936, the Thylacine received legal protection under Tasmanian law (Mooney and Rounsevell 2023). In 1966, a 647,000 ha game reserve was set up in south-western Tasmania, partly to protect any animals possibly remaining in the area.

However, it is known to have survived until almost immediately prior to European arrival in the Caribbean, suggesting strongly that pre-Columbian human impacts did not cause its disappearance and that it persisted into the historical period. Several reports of rats being eaten on Nevis and St. Kitts, in one instance of animals specifically described as “unusual-looking” (i.e., suggesting a difference from introduced Black Rats), have been reported from the seventeenth, eighteenth, and twentieth centuries, until the 1930s, and may well represent this species. However, several weeks of survey work in 2009 (involving live trapping with Sherman and Tomahawk traps) at various elevations in the forests of Nevis Peak found no evidence of the Nevis Rice Rat’s continued survival, and instead discovered very high densities of invasive mongoose and Black Rats throughout the island’s forests (S. Turvey unpublished data). The species is therefore assessed as Extinct.","Nothing is known about this species’ habitat or ecology. This island rice rat was about the same size as a Black Rat, and therefore much smaller than Megalomys, the other recently extinct endemic insular Caribbean rice rat genus (see Turvey et al. 2010).","The cause of extinction of the Nevis Rice Rat is unknown. However, its survival until the European historical era suggests that its extinction may have been driven by predation or competition with invasive mammals, probably introduced Black Rats or mongoose.",This species is now extinct.,"The Nevis Rice Rat is thought to have formerly occurred on the three main islands of the Saint Kitts Bank (Nevis, Saint Kitts and Saint Eustatius) (Turvey et al. 2010), though ancient DNA analyses have suggested that there may have been sufficient genetic differentiation between each island to constitute three distinct species (Brace et al. 2015). It has been recorded from numerous pre-Columbian zooarchaeological sites, as it constituted a major component of the diet of prehistoric Amerindians (Turvey et al. 2010).","This species was widely exploited by Amerindians for food during the recent prehistoric period, but its continued presence in kitchen middens dating closely before European arrival in the Caribbean c. 500 years ago suggests that this exploitation did not seriously impact its population. Animals specifically identified as rats, and therefore possibly representing this species, were described as providing “good meat” on St. Kitts (Harlow 1925), and in 1720 it was reported that “in Nevis some people do eat Rats, wrapping them up in banano-leaves to bake them as it were under warm embers” (Merrill 1958).

The breeding season was between December and July, with the nest excavated into a rotten tree (Jenkins 1983, Fry and Fry 1999). Clutch size ranges from 1-3 eggs, though only one chick will fledge due to siblicide (S. Medina in litt. 2020). Incubation lasts about 23 days and fledging of chicks occurs after 33 days (G. Wiles in litt. 2020).

Fledged chicks remain near the ground for several days before they can fly properly and are at particular risk from predation (Faike 2006, Banko et al. 2002). Captive-reared birds have suffered from disease, with at least one dying from a bacterial infection, and diseases may have made others more vulnerable to predation (Maxfield 1998, Banko et al. 2002, Banko 2009, USFWS 2009). The captive population is inbred (Faike 2006, USFWS 2009), and this may be reducing reproductive success. West Nile Virus, which could potentially be introduced by migrating shorebirds and waterfowl or commercial transport, and is spread by mosquitoes (Faike 2006), could threaten reintroduction efforts in the future. West Nile Virus is presumed to be highly lethal in C. hawaiiensis, owing to a reduction in the population of the American Crow C. brachyrhynchos in mainland North America by 45% over eight years due to the virus (J. Burgett in litt. 2007). Risk factors identified during reintroduction attempts include B. solitarius predation (thought to be the main factor causing mortality of released individuals), mammal predation, disease and poor nutritional condition as well as exposure to cold, wet and windy conditions (DLNR and USFWS 2023).","In 1992, there were only 11 birds in the wild (Maxfield 1998, Banko et al. 2002, Banko 2009), and the last two individuals were last seen in June 2002. The last known wild chick fledged in 1992, and the last viable wild egg was laid in 1996 (Faike 2006). The species currently persists only in captivity at two conservation breeding facilities on Hawai‘i Island and east Maui and reintroduction efforts thus far have been unsuccessful (DLNR and USFWS 2023).","Historically distributed on Hawai'i in the Hawaiian Islands (USA), where the last individuals were found in and around the Kona Forest Unit of Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge. Bones of this or a closely related species have been found on Maui, indicating a wider distribution before Western contact (Banko et al. 2002, Banko 2009). Nesting by the last known wild birds was probably confined to higher elevations on Mauna Loa in South Kona (Faike 2006, Banko 2009).",,Terrestrial,"Conservation Actions UnderwayCurrently survives only in captivity at two conservation breeding facilities on Hawai‘i Island and east Maui. In 2011, the captive population stood at 94 individuals (49 at the Keauhou Bird Conservation Center, 44 at the Maui Bird Conservation Center, and 1 at the San Diego Zoo), including 39 birds used as breeders (Switzer 2011). As of September 2023, the captive populations in breeding facilities on Hawai'i and Maui host 112 birds (though there are also two birds at the Pana‘ewa Zoo in Hilo, Hawai'i) (DLNR and USFWS 2023). Captive breeding started in the 1970s, but few fledglings were produced until eggs from wild nests were harvested and hatched in captivity during 1993-1996 (Lieberman and Kuehler 2009, Banko 2009). Reintroduction attempts have thus far been unsuccessful in large part due to high predation by Hawaiian Hawk (Buteo solitarius). A total of 27 captive-reared juveniles, originating from eggs laid either in the wild or in captivity, were released during 1993-1998 (Banko 2009, USFWS 2009). By 1999, 21 released birds had died with deaths primarily attributed to B. solitarius predation, but also toxoplasmosis, other infections and mammal predation. The remaining six were captured to protect them and preserve genetic diversity (Maxfield 1998, Conrow 1999, Banko 2009, USFWS 2009).Subsequent releases involving supplemental feeding, anti-predatory training and mammalian predator control were conducted in two different release areas within Pu'u Maka'ala Natural Area Reserve, one in the southern portion in 2016, and the other in the northern portion from 2017–2019. Of the five birds released in 2016, two were predated by B. solitarius within one week. Of the 27 released in 2017-2019, only five survived by 2020 and these were recaptured for reintegration into the captive flock (DLNR and USFWS 2023). Deaths are thought to be a result of hawk and (to a much lesser extent) mammal predation, disease, poor nutritional condition as well as exposure to cold, wet and windy conditions during a winter storm in 2019-2020 and possible conspecific aggression (DLNR and USFWS 2023). As B. solitarius are rarely sighted on Maui, the release of Hawaiian Crow in wet forest in the east has been proposed to determine whether breeding and survival will be improved in the absence of significant predation pressure here (DLNR and USFWS 2023).A recovery plan was prepared in 1982 and revised in 2009, outlining recovery actions including expanding the captive propagation to minimise loss of genetic diversity, protecting suitable habitat and managing threats to the species, establishing new populations in managed habitat, establishing a program to increase public support, and continuing research and adaptive management practices for species recovery (USFWS 2009). Each year, around 2,000 school children and students attend the environmental education programme and see C. hawaiiensis in captivity at the Keauhou Bird Conservation Centre (Faike 2006).Conservation Actions ProposedBetter understand the reasons behind previous reintroduction failures. Restore and manage a significant proportion of remaining habitat within the species' historical range as well as outside the historical range where releases are planned. Develop captive breeding programmes and reintroduce birds to habitat managed to reduce major threats. Exclude ungulates from more areas of habitat. Control potential mammalian predators and vectors of disease. Release individuals in release sites identified on Maui to determine whether breeding and survival will be improved in the absence of significant predation pressure here (DLNR and USFWS 2023).",Oceanian,Global
