132315266,22678486,"Mitu mitu","ANIMALIA","CHORDATA","GALLIFORMES","AVES","CRACIDAE","Extinct in the Wild","1988",2018,"2018-08-07 00:00:00 UTC",3.1,"English","The last (unconfirmed) sighting of this species was in the late 1980s and it is now considered Extinct in the Wild. There are two captive populations. An apparently suitable forest remnant has been identified for future reintroduction efforts.","The species was apparently confined to lowland primary forest, where it was known to take fruit of Phyllanthus, Eugenia and ""mangabeira"" (see Muñoz and Kattan 2007). In captivity, the female lays two or three eggs per clutch. The age of youngest breeding female was two years (del Hoyo 1994).","The extinction of this species had been forecast since its discovery. Ceaseless clearance of its lowland forest habitat, chiefly for sugarcane, and poaching had soon brought it to the verge of extinction. Sugarcane demand increased dramatically in the late 1970s, owing to a government programme to increase fuel alcohol production, hastening the destruction of remaining habitat. Pesticide-use in cane fields surrounding extant forest may also have had a detrimental effect. The last remaining area of reasonably extensive lowland forest in the region was virtually entirely cleared within six months in the late 1980s, while continued hunting served only to exacerbate the species's decline. The captive population, which was established from only three individuals, has been undergoing a severe bottleneck with a drastic decrease in genetic diversity (Costa et al. 2017). However, despite the loss of genetic diversity and the subsequent hybridization with M. tuberosum, several purebred M. mitu have persisted throughout the 35 years of captive breeding (Costa et al. 2017).","A captive population was established in Rio de Janeiro in 1977. Currently the population is kept in two aviaries, numbering over 100 purebred individuals and additionally around 40 hybrids of M. mitu and the Amazonian Razor-billed Curassow M. tuberosum (Pereira et al. 2014). In 2017, two individuals were transferred to an aviary in Mata do Cedro to prepare for the reintroduction. The reintroduction is scheduled to take place during 2018 (Lisboa 2017).","Mitu mitu was endemic to the Pernambuco Centre of Endemism (Alagoas and Pernambuco, north-east Brazil), where it has almost certainly been extirpated. A report from north Bahia is unreliable. It went unreported between the mid-17th century, when found in Pernambuco, and 1951, when rediscovered around São Miguel dos Campos, Alagoas. Since the early 1970s, there are records from four forests in this region. Most likely, the species was uncommon and not widespread within its presumed historical distribution (Silveira et al. 2004): Numbers were probably as few as 20, even in the 1960s (del Hoyo 1994). The most recent reports were of hunted individuals in 1984 and perhaps 1987 or 1988.","","Terrestrial","Conservation Actions UnderwayCITES Appendix I and protected under Brazilian law. In 2003, the Committee for the Recovery and Management of Alagoas Curassow Mitu mitu was created (Brooks 2006). A private captive population, supplemented from the wild, was established in 1977, and divided between two well known aviculturists in 1999 when it numbered 44 individuals, with 10 eggs in artificial incubation (Atualidades Ornitológicas 2000). A 30 km2 forest remnant in Alagoas (Reserva Particular do Patrimonio Natural Mata do Cedro) has been identified for potential reintroduction attempts by the government of Alagoas (Grau et al. 2003, Gama et al. 2016). In autumn 2017, the first two individuals were transferred to a 400 m2 aviary in Mata do Cedros to adapt to the reintroduction site. The reintroduction is scheduled to start in 2018 (Lisboa 2017). Other efforts in 1983-1985 to capture wild individuals for a captive-breeding population failed. Searches of remaining forest fragments in 2001 failed to find any trace of the species (Silveira et al. 2003). The genetic composition of the captive population has been studied by Mercival Francisco and a studbook created (L. F. Silveira in litt. 2012).Conservation Actions ProposedContinue and further develop the current captive-breeding programme in order to reintroduce the species (Collar and Butchart 2013). Maintain the genetic integrity of the species. Ensure the habitat quality of the forests at Mata do Cedro and, where necessary, restore the species's habitat and create dispersal corridors (Brooks 2006).

The last reliable wild record dates from 1900, and a search beginning in 1910 failed to find it.","It was a nomadic species, breeding and foraging in vast flocks millions of birds strong. It exploited seasonally available crops of beechmast, acorns and chestnuts; scouting for food sources and infomation sharing was likely to have required flocks of a certain critical size, below which survival would be compromised. Birds nested in April or May in vast colonies typically 16 by 5 km in size.","The precise cause of its extinction is difficult to determine, but the widespread clearance of the hardwood trees which provided its mast food, and the proliferation of the rail network and telegraph system which enabled efficient location of nesting colonies and the transport of young birds to market are probably the two single most important factors. Other important factors were excessive shooting, Newcastle disease, and towards the last of their years, the breakdown of social facilitation (Halliday 1980, Blockstein and Tordoff 1985, Bucher 1992).","None remain.","Ectopistes migratorius was found in forest in eastern and central Canada and the USA, occasionally wandering south to Mexico and Cuba. Over the 19th century, the species crashed from being one of the most abundant birds in the world to extinction (Schorger 1955). The last wild bird was shot in 1900, and surveys in 1910-1911 failed to record any (Blockstein and Tordoff 1985).

Following the application of new methods for estimating the probability of a species remaining extant, the species is now considered to be Extinct in the Wild. The species's decline was primarily the result of trapping for trade plus habitat loss.","It was found in the caatinga scrub zone, apparently requiring gallery woodland dominated by caraiba Tabebuia caraiba trees for nesting, but feeding mainly on two regionally characteristic Euphorbiaceae plant species. Breeding occurred during the austral summer. Two or three eggs were laid in the wild (up to five in captivity). The wild bird and the P. maracana apparently produced infertile eggs, although one experienced very early embryo death, subsequent DNA analysis revealing a hybrid.","The decline of the species has generally been attributed to two principal factors. First, long-term destruction of the specific gallery woodland habitat on which the species apparently depended, the result of the colonisation and exploitation of the region along the rio São Francisco corridor during more than three centuries. Secondly, trapping for the illegal live bird trade in recent decades pushed the species towards extinction. In addition, the colonisation of the distributional range by introduced aggressive African bees, and the building of the Sobradinho hydroelectric dam above Juazeiro may have contributed, perhaps significantly, to the species's decline in the 1970s and 1980s. Direct hunting is considered a factor of minor importance in the overall decline (Barros et. al. 2012), even though several reports of shooting are on record. The remaining caatinga habitat has suffered degradation and clearance as a result of grazing by cattle and goats (Barros et. al. 2012).","The species is now considered to be Extinct in the Wild (Butchart et. al. 2018).","This species was known for over 150 years, from small numbers of traded birds and a hunted bird taken by von Spix, until it was traced in 1985-1986 to near the rio São Francisco in north Bahia, Brazil. Only three birds remained and these were captured for trade in 1987 and 1988. However, a single male, paired with a female Blue-winged Macaw Propyrrhura maracana, was discovered at the site in July 1990. A female C. spixii was released from captivity in 1995 and initially paired with the male. Unfortunately, the female disappeared from the release site after seven weeks and is suspected to have collided with a power-line (Caparroz et al. 2001). The wild bird was still paired with the female P. maracana in January 2000 (Y. de Melo Barros in litt. 1999, 2000) but neither bird has been seen since the end of that year. In 2000, the total number of publicly declared birds in captivity was 60, but 54 of these were captive-bred (Schischakin 2000). The official captive population in 2015 totalled over 100 individuals (EcoAmericas 2015), with further individuals in private ownership. There have been occasional local reports, including from Serra da Capivara National Park, and a bird was filmed near Curaçá in June 2016, but this is now thought to have been a release from captivity. There have been no other records since 2000, despite fieldworker presence and surveying effort. Following the application of new methods for estimating the probability of a species remaining extant (Akcakaya et al. 2017, Keith et al. 2017, Thompson et al. 2017) the probability of Spix's Macaw being extant in the wild was estimated at 0.00006 based on records and surveys, and 0.083 based on threats (Butchart et al. 2018).

The majority of the captive individuals are currently held by Al-Wabra Wildlife Preservation (AWWP) in Qatar, which has maintained the species since 1984, with other captive individuals held in Brazil and Germany.In 2009 AWWP announced the purchase of the 2,200 ha Concordia Farm in Bahia, the site of one of the last recorded sightings of wild Spix's Macaw (October 2000) (Al-Wabra Wildlife Preservation undated). Concordia Farm was also the release site for the only captive Spix's Macaw yet to be released back into the wild, in 1995. Concordia Farm abuts the 400 ha Gangorra Farm, previously purchased by a conservation consortium.

It is accordingly considered Extinct. The last documented observation of this species was made in February 1995 in Morocco. The relative impact of threats that caused extinction are imperfectly understood, however habitat loss and hunting are thought to have been the main causes.","Behaviour: This species was migratory (del Hoyo et al. 1996). It was thought to breed in small colonies with nests between 2-3 m and 10-15 m apart (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Early records often referred to the species as occurring in large flocks on migration and in winter. However, the last records almost all involved individuals or small groups. The peak of the autumn migration appears to occur around September, with the spring migration peaking around March (Gretton 1991).Habitat: Breeding The only known nests were recorded in bog-forest transition zones (Gretton 1991) on the northern limit of the forest-steppe zone in habitat more typical of taiga marsh. This may represent either a very specialised breeding habitat requirement, or an unusual use of habitat at the limit of the species' breeding range (Gretton 1991). Non-breeding On migration and in winter, this species used a wide variety of habitats, including saltmarsh, wet grassland, steppe grassland, fishponds, saltpans, brackish lagoons, tidal mudflats, semi-desert, brackish wetlands and sandy farmland next to lagoons. Large coastal wetland complexes may have been especially characteristic, and most records come from close to the sea (Buchanan et al. 2010). When it wintered inland, it inhabited marsh areas fed with freshwater, but with areas of Salicornia indicating that the ground had a high salt content (Gretton 1991).Diet: There is little information on this species' diet: birds at Merja Zerga (Morocco) fed on earthworms and tipulid larvae, while elsewhere insects (there is a suspicion that orthoptera may have been an important food source [N. Crockford in litt. 2012]), molluscs and crustaceans were recorded as prey. Breeding site: A nest found by Ushakov in 1914 was constructed of dry grass with a few leaves of rush Scirpus but little or no sedge (Gretton 1991). The known nests were situated on dry areas of sedge and bog moss some distance from willow scrub or birch grove (Gretton 1991). An analysis of stable isotopes in feather samples from museum skins suggest that the main breeding area was located further south than the historically confirmed sites; in the steppes of northern Kazakhstan and southern central Russia between 48°N and 56°N, with a core area around 50°N (Buchanan et al. 2018).","While the threats that drove this species extinct will never perfectly be known, habitat loss and hunting were likely to have been the two main threats.On the species' probable breeding grounds (see Buchanan et al. 2018), extensive drainage and conversion of steppe to arable farming plausibly drove rapid declines (Buchanan et al. 2018, 2025). In the late 19th century and early to mid-20th century, these changes were particularly widespread (Belik 1994, Klein Goldewijk et al. 2011, Kraemer et al. 2015, Fluet-Chouinard et al. 2023) and were potentially exacerbated by heat-waves and droughts (Schubert et al. 2014). Similar threats are thought to have affected wintering and passage areas. The conversion of European wetlands and central European steppes to arable farmland may have heavily impacted the species by depriving it of important habitats during migration (Gretton 1991, Donald et al. 2010). For example, the Pannonian Plain, from which there are multiple records from multiple sites, has been almost entirely converted to agriculture (Gretton 1991, Buchanan et al. 2025). Gretton (1991) noted that the Evros Delta and Amvrakikos have been drained, while Merja Zerga (the last known wintering locality), in Morocco, stands out as one of the only wetlands in the Maghreb not to be converted to agriculture (Gretton 1991, Buchanan et al. 2025). Historically hunting pressure was high and may have been a significant factor in its decline (although this is difficult to prove), particularly once the population had already been depleted by other threats and habitat loss led to a concentration of birds at relatively few sites. Hunting parties were said to have shot multiple Slender-billed Curlews at Merja Zerga (Morocco) in the 1980s, at a time when the global population size was probably already small. The species was said to be tame (Gretton 1991) and its preference for suptratidal areas (which were also among the first affected by land-use change) probably made it particularly vulnerable to hunting (Buchanan et al. 2025). Some birds were found in food markets (Gretton 1991) and as the species became rarer, so the value of specimens increased (Gretton 1991, Nowak 1995, Buchanan et al. 2025). Following the initial decline, breakdown of social behaviour patterns may have prevented recovery. Historically a gregarious species, smaller groups or individuals may have had difficulty in locating suitable stop-over sites on migration (Gretton 1991).","There are reports that this species was locally quite common historically (Gretton 1991), however as early 1912 it was suggested that it was declining (Ushakov 1912) and a foreboding warning of its extinction was raised (but largely ignored/overlooked) in the 1940s (Stresemann and Grote 1943). By the time an action plan was published in 1996 (Gretton 1996), it was almost certainly too late. In total, 1,174 records were collated by Buchanan et al. (2025) spanning 1820 to 2011. The last specimen was collected in 1983; the most recent confirmed photograph (showing the identification criteria as outlined by Corso et al. 2014) was in Merja Zerga, Morocco, in 1995 (van den Berg 1995). All records since are unconfirmed, and most claims have proven to be Whimbrel N. phaeopus or Eurasian Curlew N. arquata. Despite considerable effort to search for the species (Gallo-Orsi and Boere 2001, Crockford and Buchanan 2017, Buchanan et al. 2025), no documented observations have been made for thirty years.Following methods developed in a series of papers published in 2017 (Akcakaya et al. 2017, Keith et al. 2017, Thompson et al. 2017), the probability that this species is extinct based on records and surveys is 0.994 (0.970-0.999), and the probability it is extinct based on threats is 0.926 (0.808-0.981) (analysis published by Buchanan et al. 2025). It is accordingly considered Extinct. An alternative, Bayesian modelling approach (Solow and Beet 2014: model 2; detailed in Carlson et al. 2018, Bond et al. 2019) also published by Buchanan et al. (2025) reached the same conclusion: 'The probability that the species remains extant in 2022 is less than 5 × 10−8'.","The breeding range of this species is not well understood. The only confirmed breeding was near Tara, north Omsk in Siberia, Russia, between 1909 and 1925 (Gretton et al. 2002). Recent stable isotope analysis (Buchanan et al. 2018) has suggested that the majority of the species' breeding range was however to the south of this, centred on the Kazakh Steppe mostly in Kazakhstan.The species' non-breeding range was evidently much more extensive (e.g. Gretton 1991, BirdLife International 1999, Kirwan et al. 2015, Buchanan et al. 2025), but a full elucidation is hampered by identification difficulties (see Corso et al. 2014, Kirwan et al. 2015). For example, most records for the Middle East should now be considered doubtful (Kirwan et al. 2015, R. Porter in litt. 2025), but most specimen or photographed records are from what is assumed to have been the main wintering area in the Mediterranean Basin (Gretton 1991, Kirwan et al. 2008, 2015, Buchanan et al. 2025). The last-known wintering site for the species was Merga Zerga, in western Morocco, where the last sighting was on 23 February 1995 (van den Berg 1995). There have been no verified sightings of the species since, and it is now thought to be extinct (Buchanan et al. 2025).","The degree to which hunting of this species was a factor in its extinction is not well known, but it is acknowledged by Buchanan et al. (2025) that hunting pressure on other species in the range of Slender-billed Curlew is generally high. Gretton (1991) noted that organised hunting trips to Merga Zerga in the 1980s, by which time the species was probably already rare, shot multiple Slender-billed Curlews. The species' preference for supratidal areas may have made it more accessible to hunters, and it apparently was tamer than other shorebirds (Gretton 1991, Buchanan et al. 2025). There are a number of records of skins being found in food markets (Gretton 1991) and skins of the species were increasingly sought by collectors as the species became rarer (Gretton 1991, Nowak 1995, Buchanan et al. 2025).","Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine","","Palearctic","Global"

However, increasing pressure on breeding sites from local reed-cutting and from tourism development, along with the murder of the government game warden for the national park during the political unrest of 1982 and falling lake levels following the earthquake of 1976, are likely to be the factors which drove the population to extinction (LaBastille 1990). Drowning in gill nets and disturbance by increasing boat traffic have also been suggested as contributory factors (Collar et al. 1994).","In 1929, the maximum population was estimated at c. 400 individuals (Llimona et al. 2020).
