Therefore it is listed as Extinct. It seems likely that the increasing human settlement of Cabo Polonio by people, the actions of domestic predatory animals, and disturbance resulting from tourism, particularly during the breeding season, were all factors contributing to its extinction.","Cabo Polonio is a small coastal granitic outcrop of about 0.2 km2 with sandy soil (Borteiro et al. 2013).","It seems likely that the increasing human settlement of Cabo Polonio by people, with an attendant increase in the numbers of predatory dogs and cats, and massive tourism, particularly during the summer months (the lizards’ reproductive season) could have caused its extinction (Cabrera and Carreira 2009).","This lizard is thought to be extinct. The last record is from the 1977 (Cabrera and Carreira 2009). Federico Achaval discovered this population, at the time considered conspecific with C. lacertoides. Besides this researcher's efforts (probably more than 30 days of surveys in each of the past 20 years) to locate this species, several systematic surveys have been carried on the area in the decades following its discovery but the species has not been located since then.","Contomastix charrua was known only from Cabo Polonio, southern Uruguay (Cabrera and Carreira 2009, Borteiro et al. 2013). It is believed to be extinct (Cabrera and Carreira 2009). Cabo Polonio is no more than 15 m asl (Borteiro et al. 2013).","This species was not utilized or traded.","Terrestrial","It was a priority species for conservation in Uruguay (Carreira and Estrades 2013), but was considered extinct by Carreira and Maneyro (2015). It was found in Cabo Polonio National Park. Taxonomic research is required to emsure that this species is not conspecific with another extant taxon (see Taxonomic Notes).","Neotropical","Global"

No new records of this species have been made in over 90 years. In the 1980s there were several unsuccessful searches for Tetradactylus eastwoodae using arrays of drift fences, pitfall and funnel traps, as well as active searching. Surveys were conducted in the last remaining patches of open grassland in the Haenertsburg area (Jacobsen 1988, 1989), e.g., in a small, now degraded area close to a stream between Woodbush Forest and Haenertsburg (possibly where one of the two recorded specimens was collected), as well as an open area of grassland and shrubby vegetation adjacent to a forest that had not been burnt for about 20 years. In April 2008, a 10-day survey was conducted in grasslands in the Woodbush-Haenertsburg area using both active searching and drift fence trapping in a concerted but unsuccessful attempt to re-discover this species (Bates and Jacobsen 2018).","Given the ecology of congeners, this species is presumed to have occurred in open montane grassland. Historical photographs (Wongtschowski 1990) show that at the time the holotype was collected the area was open grassland. If a population still persists, it would most likely occur in grassland remnants in the Woodbush, Haenertsburg or Wolkberg areas. The area of the type locality as well as much of the surrounding area was extensively transformed for silviculture in about 1950.","The habitat of this species has been largely destroyed by afforestation, agriculture and associated infrastructure. Too frequent fires in grassland has probably contributed to the demise of this species.","Recent surveys targeting this species have not produced any additional observations or records (Bates and Jacobsen 2014, V. Egan pers. comm. 2021, K.A .Tolley unpub. data 2021).","This species occurred in the Woodbush-Haenertsburg area in Limpopo Province, South Africa. The type locality is “the Woodbush (Zoutpansberg District)” (Hewitt and Methuen 1913), but much of the Woodbush area is now under plantations (Jacobsen 1988, 1989). The type locality has been restricted to the farm Broedersdrift 958LS (Bates and Jacobsen 2014).","No collecting known since capture of the only two specimens recorded in 1911 and 1928.","Terrestrial","Although considered Extinct, additional targeted surveys of habitat fragments in remaining grassland in the Woodbush, Haenertsburg and Wolkberg areas should be carried out to increase confidence in this assessment. The Woodbush Granite Grassland in which this species probably occurred is not under formal protection and is considered Critically Endangered habitat type (Mucina et al. 2006). Formal protection of the remaining grassland fragments would be essential, should any surviving populations be found.","Afrotropical","Global"

There are also no captive specimens, so the species is considered Extinct (see Broadley 1994).","The habitat preference and ecology of this species are unknown.","Conversion of habitat in the Durban area for agriculture and human settlement are likely to be the cause of extinction (Bourquin 1988, Broadley 1994).","No specimens have been identified in more than 130 years since the description of the species, despite directed searches.","Described by Boulenger in 1887 on the basis of a single specimen from 'Port Natal' near Durban. Has not been found again in more than 130 years, despite extensive surveys in the greater Durban area, including Marianhill, where the Reverend Henry Callaway is believed to have found the only specimen when traveling by ox-wagon from Pietermaritzburg (Marais and Bauer 2014).","This species is not known to have been utilized or traded in any way.","Terrestrial","Given that details on the original collection locality and habitat are vague, additional surveys could be conducted in the greater Durban area to widen the search for this species.","Afrotropical","Global"
