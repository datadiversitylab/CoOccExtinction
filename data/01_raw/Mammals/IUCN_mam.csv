22159785,7121,"Elaphurus davidianus","ANIMALIA","CHORDATA","ARTIODACTYLA","MAMMALIA","CERVIDAE","Extinct in the Wild","1939",2016,"2016-03-31 00:00:00 UTC",3.1,"English","This species is listed as Extinct in the Wild. The captive population in China has increased in recent years, and the possibility remains that free-ranging populations can be established some time in the near future. When that happens, its Red List status will need to be reassessed.","Studies have been carried out on the behaviour, ecology and reproduction of Père David’s Deer in Beijing since 1985, in Dafeng since 1986, and in Shishou since 2001. This species lives in low-lying grasslands and reed beds, often in seasonally flooded areas such as the lower Yangtze River valley and coastal marshes. It eats grass, reeds and leaves of bushes, can swim well, and spend long periods in water. It lives in single sex ormaternal herds. Animals reach maturity during second year. Gestation is 270-300 days. One, rarely two young are born. These are weaned in 10-11 months. Adults live up to 18 years. Data from the Dafeng Reserve suggests that female E. davidianus establish a home range of approximately 1 km² (Hu and Jiang 2002).","The species became extinct in the wild due to habitat loss and hunting. The size of the reintroduced population was only 120 in 1993 (Cao 1993), although has increased to over 2,000 since that time (Yang et al. 2008). Low genetic diversity has been identified as a long-term threat by Zeng et al. (2007) and Yang et al. (2008). It is unclear how much native habitat remains on which E. davidianus can exist in a free-ranging state.","After decades of ex situ conservation, the species breeds successfully in captivity (Beck and Wemmer 1983). In China there are now fenced populations in Beijing, Dafeng, Shishou and Yuanyang. The first conservation reintroduction of Père David’s Deer to China included two groups, of 20 deer (5 males : 15 females) and 18 deer (all females), in 1985 and 1987, respectively. All 38 deer were donated by the Marquess of Tavistock of Woburn Abbey (later the 14th Duke of Bedford), who also covered transportation costs of the first group. After a careful search and evaluation by a group of zoologists, botanists, wildlife managers and officers, the relic site of the Nanyuang Royal Hunting Garden in the southern suburbs of Beijing was chosen as the site of re-introduction, creating the Beijing Milu Park (39°07'N, 116°03'E), with an area of 60 ha. The deer in the park have received supplemental feeding year round (Jiang et al. 2000a).The second re-introduction of E. davidianus was carried out in August of 1987, organized by former Ministry of Forestry and funded by WWF. A group of 39 Père David’s Deer was selected from five zoological gardens in the United Kingdom, with the deer mainly from the Whipsnade Wild Animal Park. An extensive search, which covered a vast area in eastern China for a potential reintroduction site was conducted before a decision was made. The Dafeng State-Owen Forestry Farm was chosen, on the Yellow Sea coast in eastern China in a lightly populated area (semi-fossils of Père David’s Deer have been excavated from the neighbouring counties, so this site is probably in its natural habitat). The introduced herd was released into three fenced paddocks, each about 100 ha in area. The reserve purchased another 30 km² land in 1995, more than doubling its original size. In 1997, the Dafeng Milu Natural Reserve was approved by the National Nature Reserve Commission as a national nature reserve. The Dafeng Milu Nature Reserve has the potential to host a large population of Père David’s Deer. The reserve has kept the reintroduced Père David’s Deer and their offspring on its land, and in 1998 the first group of deer was released from the paddocks into the wider reserve (Hu and Jiang 2002). In 2003, and 2006 another two groups of deer were released from the paddocks. There were 950 Père David’s Deer in the reserve in 2006. The annual average population growth rate of deer in the reserve was 17.01%. This Père David’s Deer conservation strategy calls for further expanding of the DafengMilu Nature Reserve (Jiang et al. 2000b). The Beijing Milu Park is in the southeast suburb of Beijing with a limited area and is now part of a much larger ‘Wetland Park’ being established (2012-2016), whereas the DafengMilu Nature Reserve is located in a remote coastal region with little human settlement, where it is possible to acquire more land for conservation. Therefore, the Beijing Milu Park while keeping a healthy nuclear breeding herd of about 200 deer at the park, is shipping Père David’s Deer to other sites in east China (Yang 2007) and in Hebei Province. The translocations thus reduced the grazing pressure on the park vegetation and expanded the distribution range of the Père David’s Deer in the country. The average annual population growth rate for Père David’s Deer in Beijing Milu Park from 1987-1997 was 17.3%. This Père David’s Deer conservation strategy calls for an expansion of this artificial dispersal of animals to establish new sites (Jiang et al. 2000b). E. davidianus from the Beijing Milu Park have been relocated to the lower reaches of the Yangtze River in eastern China and Hainan Island in the South China Sea. In October 1993, a group of 30 Père David’s Deer (8 males : 22 females) arrived and was released in a paddock on a small peninsular along the Yangtze River, Shishou (29°49'N,112°33'E). This site was later established as the Hubei Shishou Milu National Nature Reserve. The size of the reserve is 11.67 km². Another group of 34 Père David’s Deer (10 males : 24 females) was transferred from the Beijing Milu Park to the Shishou paddock in the following year to enlarge the population. An additional 30 deer (15 males : 15 females) were released into the paddock of the reserve in 2002. The relocated deer reproduced in the second year after the relocation (Yang et al. 2002). By the end of calving season of 2006, there were 522 E. davidianus in the Shishou Milu National Nature Reserve. The annual average population growth rate was 22.2%. The birth rate and population growth rate in Shishou were significantly higher whereas the mortality rate was significantly lower than those of the Dafeng Nature Reserve. In November, 2002, 30 E. davidianus (14 males : 16 females) from Beijing Milu Park and 20 from the DafengMilu Nature Reserve were introduced to Yuanyang Forestry Farm, Henan. These deer are in an enclosure on the Yuanyang Yellow River Nature Reserve (35°11'N, 114°15'E). In 2006, there were 53 deer in the Yuanyang Yellow River Nature Reserve paddock, but the sex ratio was predominately male biased (38 males : 15 females) (Li et al. 2007). Currently, there are a total of 53 herds of E. davidianus in China. Nine herds have fewer than 25 deer, 75.5% have fewer than 10 deer (Yang et al. 2003). Such a small herd size raise question about the effective population size and health of population genetics, since those herds are isolated and there is no gene exchange. The artificially dispersed E. davidianus herds are similar to a meta-population. The viability of the meta-population depends on the man-made gene exchange process by the managers. There are now four wild populations (not fenced) living in Hubei and Hunan provinces established by escaped individuals from Shishou Nature Reserve during severe flooding in 1998. The latest data from 2015 suggests that the wild population is about 600 individuals (M. Boyd pers. comm. 2015), surveys need to be conducted to assess the long-term viability of these populations.","This species is endemic to China. Père David’s Deer has been recovered from the brink of extinction and has become a classic example of how to rescue a highly threatened species (Ebenehard 1995). In the mid 1980s, Père David’s Deer was re-introduced into captive facilities in China, and populations established first in Beijing and then in Dafeng, Shishou and Yuanyang. Fossils of Elaphurus bifurcatus, E. chinanensis chia, E. lantianensis have been excavated from the region east of Xi’an and south of Harbin. The modern species of Elaphurus, Père David’s Deer (Milu in Chinese) evolved in the Pliocene period of the Tertiary, according to fossils excavated in southern Japan. During the Pleistocene period, it was known from Manchuria (Hofmann 2007). During the Holocene, P. davidianus was restricted to swamps and wetlands in the region south of 43°N and east of 110°E in mainland China (Cao 1993, Zhou 2007). However, the distribution of P. davidianus shrank and its population declined due to hunting and land reclamation in the swamp areas as human population expanded (Jiang and Li 1999). P. davidianus is believed to have been largely extinct in the wild 1500 years before the last head was decimated by the late 19th century during the Boxer Rebellion in Beijing.During the Qing Dynasty (1616-1911), the Nanyuang Royal Hunting Garden contained a herd of P. davidianus in its 200 km² hunting ground. This hunting garden in the southern suburbs of Beijing was predominantly a wetland, consisting of swamps, ponds and lakes crossed by the Yongding River. The area had been sealed off from the outside world since the Yuan Dynasty (1205-1368) as a royal garden. The French missionary Père Armand David “discovered” P. davidianus in the Nanyuan Royal Hunting Garden in 1864. Realizing that the deer was an unknown species to the West, he persuaded the wardens to give him hinds and skeletons of an adult male, an adult female and a young male, and sent them to Paris in 1866, where the species was named Père David’s deer by Milne-Edwards. In 1895, the surrounding wall of the Nanyuan Hunting Garden was destroyed by a heavy flood of the Yongding River, and most of the Père David’s Deer escaped and were hunted. Only 20-30 animals survived in the garden. Then in 1900, during the Boxer Rebellion, the garden was occupied by troops and the remaining deer were shot and eaten.However, before the demise of the royal herd of Père David’s Deer in the Nanyuan Royal Hunting Garden in 1900, the deer had been introduced into private deer collections in the United Kingdom, Belgium, France and Germany. During the first decade of the 20th century, the 11th Duke of Bedford in the United Kingdom gathered the last 18 Père David’s Deer in the world to form a breeding herd at the Woburn Abbey Estate, England. Only 11 of these deer were capable of reproducing (Bedford, 1951-52). Nevertheless, the heavily inbred Père David’s Deer safely passed though the genetic bottleneck of inbreeding and adopted the vast open parkland of an English country estate (Jones et al. 1983).The captive population started to increase (though with a setback during the First World War due to food shortage), and since the Second World War, the animals started to be spread through captive facilities worldwide, with the first captive animals being sent back to Beijing Zoo in 1956.","","Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)","It is listed on the Chinese Red List as Extinct in the Wild, and on the China Key List - I. Recommended conservation action includes:1. Establish additional populations when and where appropriate, with the aim of re-establishing a genuinely wild, free-ranging population. 2. Conduct surveys of the four free-living sub-populations in Hubei and Hunan provinces to assess their long-term viability.3. Establish a genetic management programme of all populations in China. 4. Develop conservation education programmes to raise conservation awareness among the local people and general public.Following a trial release of this species in the Dafeng Reserve, China, Hu and Jiang (2002) concluded that future releases will necessitate either natural or artificial boundaries to alleviate conflict between introduced E. davidianus and farmers, on whose land the deer are likely to stray. These authors suggest a reintroduction model based on that of Oryx leucoryx in Oman (Stanley Price 1989).","Palearctic","Global"

However, recent analysis of mitochondrial DNA data (Robins et al. 2006) suggest that the light-coloured, lankier, longer-faced pigs from the northern Annamites are probably the same as the relatively light-coloured form of Sus scrofa found east of the Mekong (Galbreath 2007). The validity of this species is therefore in doubt, and it might be a synonym of Sus scrofa.","","Terrestrial","No conservation measures are in place for this species.

Radiocarbon evidence indicates a very recent disappearance (about 324–496 years cal BP), concurrent with European colonisation of this region. This species is the sister taxon of the also extinct, but insular, Falklands Wolf Dusicyon australis.","The species occupied relatively open habitats, such as grass steppe and shrub steppes, in the Pampean and Patagonian regions.","The demise of the species has been linked to habitat changes, hybridization with dogs and persecution. The abundant fossils of Dusicyon avus show a clear archaeological and temporal overlap with modern humans. A specimen was discovered in a grave from the late second millennium BC, suggesting that the animal might have been kept as a pet (Prates 2014); the teeth of Dusicyon avus were used in a religions context in some aboriginal sites of Buenos Aires province. According to new radiocarbon evidence, the species would have become extinct about 326-496 years BP (Prevosti et al. 2015), supporting the hypothesis that its disappearance might have happened after the arrival of Europeans. Anecdotal evidence exists from the diaries of 19th century naturalists and explorers of a large canid in Patagonia attributable to Dusicyon avus. Prevosti et al. (2015) found no evidence for hybridization, and proposed that the drivers of the recent extinction of the species were anthropogenic impacts, including hunting and domestic dogs, coupled with climatic change. The indigenous Ona of Tierra del Fuego recognized two species of fox, one of a large size.","The species had a widespread distribution and would have conceivably been relatively common.","Dusicyon avus lived in the Pampean and Patagonian regions of Argentina, southern Chile, Uruguay and southern Brazil.

254614193,11633,"Leporillus apicalis","ANIMALIA","CHORDATA","RODENTIA","MAMMALIA","MURIDAE","Extinct","Unknown: possibly 1950s or 1970.",2024,"2024-06-06 00:00:00 UTC",3.1,"English","The last two specimens were collected by Norman Tindale, near Mt Crombie, south of the Musgrave Ranges in northwestern South Australia in July 1933. Tindale (1933) recorded the burning of the stick-nest rats’ nest and the capture of the fleeing inhabitants on his ‘Mann Ranges 1933’ black-and-white film (copies held by the South Australian Museum and by the University of Adelaide). There have been unconfirmed reports since, including one from 1970, and occasional reports of fresh vegetation being added to old stick-nests, but there is little doubt that the species is Extinct.","Stick-nest Rats constructed large nests of sticks and sometimes stones, depending on available construction materials. Some remaining in caves in breakaways in the Gibson Desert and near the Finke stock route in the southern Northern Territory are more than 3 m by 2 m by 1 m high. Stick nests were also built in wooded country well away from ranges, but most have not survived (Burbidge and Fuller 1979, Copley 1999, see Tindale 1933 for black and white film when the last two specimens were collected). There are also historic records of it sheltering in tree hollows (Robinson 2023).The diet was mainly vegetarian, including leaves of chenopods, other semi-succulent shrubs, seeds and grasses, but also included invertebrates such as beetles and termites (Copley 1999, McDowell et al. 2012). The different food preferences (if not habitat preferences) between the two species of stick-nest rats are reflected in their molar teeth. Although both have incisors that are similar in being relatively narrow and fairly lightly built, their molars are very different. Those of  the Lesser Stick-nest Rat are fairly low-crowned, with quite sloping cusps and with the lophs in the lower molars forming a characteristic chevron pattern, all suggesting that the species fed on relatively high quality food, such as sandalwood nuts (whose shells are usually found in quite large numbers in their stick-nests). In contrast, the molars of the Greater Stick-nest Rat Leporillus conditor are very high-crowned, with almost vertical cusps, suggesting that they fed on larger volumes of lower quality vegetation, such as saltbush, which was fairly abrasive, because old individuals in owl pellet accumulations have quite worn-down teeth (A. Baynes pers. comm. 2011).The construction of stick-nests shows that shelter was important; the nests probably provided an ameliorated microclimate and some protection from predators. The species was social, with nests sheltering several individuals, with records of up to ten in a nest (Robinson 2023).Radiocarbon dates of stick-nest rat nest-middens have revealed dates ranging from modern to 10,900 ± 90 BP (Pearson et al. 1999). Pearson and Dodson (1991), Pearson (1999) and Webeck and Pearson (2005) have studied Stick-nest Rat middens to document past changes in vegetation and climate in central Australia, while Pearson et al. (2001) have documented animal remains in the nest-middens.","Predation by feral cats Felis catus is likely to have been the main cause of extinction. Cats had colonised the whole of Australia by the 1890s (Abbott 2002, 2008). The arrival of Red Foxes Vulpes vulpes in its range may have driven remnant subpopulations to extinction; high rabbit numbers led to high fox numbers. Habitat degradation, particularly in refuges during drought, caused by introduced herbivores (mainly rabbits and sheep) before and leading into severe drought conditions may have contributed to extinction. Morton (1990) and Copley (1999) have discussed the effects of introduced herbivores on this and other extinct mammals; Tunbridge (1991) described effects of sheep at the Flinders Ranges. Predation by indigenous predators, such as Dingoes and owls, in combination with habitat degradation by introduced herbivores was probably a minor threat on its own but possibly an enhanced threat when other threats were operating.","Krefft (1866) reported Lesser Stick-nest Rats ‘in great numbers … on both sides of the Murray River’, i.e., New South Wales and Victoria). Many early explorers commented on the abundance and large size of stick-nests, including in northern areas where only this species of Leporillus has been recorded (Copley 1999). However, by the early 20th century, explorers and naturalists reported that it was rare. Western desert Aboriginal people reported that it disappeared at least 40 to 50 years prior to the mid-1980s (Burbidge et al. 1988). The decline happened from east to west and from south to north (Copley 1999). It is now extinct.The date this species was last seen in the wild may have been as late as the 1970s, as a large rodent that was captured and released in 1970 in a cave west of the Canning Stock Route, Western Australia, may have been this species (Robinson and Burbidge 2008). Information from the aboriginal population suggest this species persisted up to about 1950 (Robinson 2023).","Collation of available records from a variety of sources (Copley 1999), including the remains of stick nests and subfossil data (e.g., Watts and Eves 1976, Baynes and Johnson 1996, summarised in Copley 1999 and Burbidge et al. 2009) shows that the Lesser Stick-nest Rat formerly ranged though semi-arid and arid Western Australia, South Australia, the Northern Territory, New South Wales and the far northwest of Victoria, although the distribution was probably patchy and dependent on there being suitable vegetation for food.The distribution of stick-nest rats formed arcs along the southeastern, southern and southwestern boundaries of the arid zone, from western Victoria to North West Cape in Western Australia.  The Lesser Stick-nest Rat occurred further inland from the arid zone boundary, reaching the MacDonnell Ranges and Uluru (Baynes and Baird 1992) and occurring in the Great Victoria and Gibson Deserts, but also extended further southwest, to Peak Charles and probably parts of the Western Australian wheatbelt (A. Baynes pers. comm. 2011).The species is now Extinct.","","Terrestrial","This species is extinct.","Australasian","Global"
