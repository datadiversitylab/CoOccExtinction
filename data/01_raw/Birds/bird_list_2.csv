Psittirostra psittacea,"Psittirostra psittacea was originally widespread in the Hawaiian Islands (USA), but was extirpated from O'ahu, Maui, Moloka'i and then Lana'i between 1899 and 1931 (Snetsinger et al. 1998). On Kaua'i, it survived in the Alaka'i Wilderness Preserve into the mid-1970s, with c. 62 birds being present during 1968-1973 (USFWS 1983), but only a few in 1981 (Scott et al. 1986), two in 1989 and none since. On Hawai'i, several populations were present in the early 1980s, with c.394 estimated during 1976-1983 (Scott et al. 1986) but, in 1984, a lava-flow from Mauna Loa passed through the Upper Waiakea Forest Reserve, the species' stronghold (Scott et al. 1986, Snetsinger et al. 1998). In 1982 and 1992 Hurricanes ‘Iwa and ‘Iniki battered the Alaka'i swamp, the last known range of Ou on Kaua'i, and had devastating effects on the native forest. Three species of bird, including Ou, were not seen on Kaua'i since these hurricanes (USFWS 2022). However, there have been unconfirmed reports from Koai'e Stream, Alaka'i (Kaua'i) and Pu'u Maka'ala Natural Area Reserve and Kapapala-Ka'u Forest Reserve (Hawai'i) up to 1996 (Snetsinger et al. 1998, J. Lepson in litt. 1999)."
Zosterops albogularis,Zosterops albogularis was endemic to Norfolk Island (to Australia). By the 1970s it had become confined to weed-free indigenous forest in and around the Norfolk Island National Park.
Hemignathus hanapepe,"Hemignathus hanapepe was endemic to Kaua'i in the Hawaiian Islands, U.S.A., where the last confirmed record was two specimens taken in 1899 (Munro 1960). It probably became confined to the Alaka'i Wilderness Preserve (Scott et al. 1986, Conant et al. 1998) and since its 'rediscovery' in 1960 (Richardson and Bowles 1964) it has been reported there at least 30 times. Although at least some, if not all, of these sightings lack sufficient evidence to eliminate Chlorodrepanis stejnegeri (Pratt and Pyle 2000)."
Loxops ochraceus,"Loxops ochraceus was endemic to Maui, Hawaiian Islands, U.S.A. Most specimens were obtained above Olinda, although some were taken from Kipahulu Valley (Pyle and Pyle 2017). Between 1950 and 1995, Loxops ochraceus were observed on the upper slopes of Haleakala, Kipahulu Valley and Ko'olau Forest Reserve. The last confirmed record in 1988 was in Hanawi Natural Area Reserve; an unconfirmed audio recording in 1994 was taken during a Rare Bird Search survey, also from Hanawi Natural Area Reserve. An unconfirmed 1995 recording was taken in Kipahulu Valley (Reynolds and Snetsinger 2001)."
Todiramphus cinnamominus,"Todiramphus cinnamominus occurred on Guam (to U.S.A.),  but became extinct in the wild in 1988 as a result of predation from the introduced brown tree snake Boiga irregularis (del Hoyo et al. 2001). What were believed to be the last 29 individuals were caught and taken into captivity in 1984-86, though presumably a very small population persisted until 1988 when the last individual was seen in the wild (Wiles et al. 2003). An estimated 139 individuals are held at 25 AZA institutions and in a facility at the Guam Department of Agriculture’s Division of Aquatic and Wildlife Resources, and breeding facilities are currently at capacity (USFWS 2023)."
Anas marecula,"Anas marecula was endemic to Amsterdam Island and St Paul Island, French Southern Territories (Hume 2017). "
Columba thiriouxi,"Columba thiriouxi is known from subfossil remains on Mauritius (Hume 2011). It is thought to have become extinct around 1730 (Hume and Walters 2012). Available specimen material is limited, and there is some doubt about the validity of the species since currently available material may not satisfactorily exclude C. livia (R. Roe in litt. 2014)."
Nesoenas duboisi,Nesoenas duboisi is based on Dubois' 1674 description of rusty-red pigeons from Réunion (Rothschild 1907).

It was last reported from an offshore islet by Iversen in 1662 (Cheke 1987), and although one analysis indicates that it is likely to have persisted until 1690 (Roberts and Solow 2004), it is generally considered that all references to ""dodos"" thereafter refer to Red Rail Aphanapteryx bonasia (Cheke 2006, Hume 2017)."
Pezophaps solitaria,"Pezophaps solitaria was endemic to Rodrigues, Mauritius, from where it is known from numerous historical accounts (Cheke 1987), with those of Leguat in 1708 providing particularly rich detail (Hachisuka 1953), and many bones (Cowles 1987)."
Corvus hawaiiensis,"Historically distributed on Hawai'i in the Hawaiian Islands (USA), where the last individuals were found in and around the Kona Forest Unit of Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge. Bones of this or a closely related species have been found on Maui, indicating a wider distribution before Western contact (Banko et al. 2002, Banko 2009). Nesting by the last known wild birds was probably confined to higher elevations on Mauna Loa in South Kona (Faike 2006, Banko 2009)."
Alectroenas nitidissimus,"Alectroenas nitidissimus is known only from three skins (Cheke 1987) and a number of descriptions and paintings (Tuijn 1969, Cheke 1987), from Mauritius (Cowles 1987)."
