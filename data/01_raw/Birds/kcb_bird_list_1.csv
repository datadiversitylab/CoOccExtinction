Mitu mitu,"Mitu mitu was endemic to the Pernambuco Centre of Endemism (Alagoas and Pernambuco, north-east Brazil), where it has almost certainly been extirpated. A report from north Bahia is unreliable. It went unreported between the mid-17th century, when found in Pernambuco, and 1951, when rediscovered around São Miguel dos Campos, Alagoas. Since the early 1970s, there are records from four forests in this region. Most likely, the species was uncommon and not widespread within its presumed historical distribution (Silveira et al. 2004): Numbers were probably as few as 20, even in the 1960s (del Hoyo 1994). The most recent reports were of hunted individuals in 1984 and perhaps 1987 or 1988.",n,
Ectopistes migratorius,"Ectopistes migratorius was found in forest in eastern and central Canada and the USA, occasionally wandering south to Mexico and Cuba. Over the 19th century, the species crashed from being one of the most abundant birds in the world to extinction (Schorger 1955). The last wild bird was shot in 1900, and surveys in 1910-1911 failed to record any (Blockstein and Tordoff 1985). The last captive bird died in 1914 in the Cincinnati Zoo (Wilcove 1989).",n,
Cyanopsitta spixii,"This species was known for over 150 years, from small numbers of traded birds and a hunted bird taken by von Spix, until it was traced in 1985-1986 to near the rio São Francisco in north Bahia, Brazil. Only three birds remained and these were captured for trade in 1987 and 1988. However, a single male, paired with a female Blue-winged Macaw Propyrrhura maracana, was discovered at the site in July 1990. A female C. spixii was released from captivity in 1995 and initially paired with the male. Unfortunately, the female disappeared from the release site after seven weeks and is suspected to have collided with a power-line (Caparroz et al. 2001). The wild bird was still paired with the female P. maracana in January 2000 (Y. de Melo Barros in litt. 1999, 2000) but neither bird has been seen since the end of that year. In 2000, the total number of publicly declared birds in captivity was 60, but 54 of these were captive-bred (Schischakin 2000). The official captive population in 2015 totalled over 100 individuals (EcoAmericas 2015), with further individuals in private ownership. There have been occasional local reports, including from Serra da Capivara National Park, and a bird was filmed near Curaçá in June 2016, but this is now thought to have been a release from captivity. There have been no other records since 2000, despite fieldworker presence and surveying effort. Following the application of new methods for estimating the probability of a species remaining extant (Akcakaya et al. 2017, Keith et al. 2017, Thompson et al. 2017) the probability of Spix's Macaw being extant in the wild was estimated at 0.00006 based on records and surveys, and 0.083 based on threats (Butchart et al. 2018). Based on the probability thresholds recommended by Butchart et al. (2018), the species is now considered to be Extinct in the Wild.",n,
Melamprosops phaeosoma,"Melamprosops phaeosoma was endemic to Maui in the Hawaiian Islands (USA), where it was discovered in 1973 in the Ko`olau Forest Reserve on the north-eastern flanks of Haleakala (Pratt et al. 1997, Rosa et al. 1998), and estimated to number fewer than 200 birds. During 1975-1985, there was a rapid decline in density in the upper Hanawi watershed (Mountainspring et al. 1990), the last area from which it was known. In 1995, only five to seven birds were known but, by mid-1997, only three individuals could be found (two male, one possibly female), each with distinct home ranges in Hanawi Natural Area Reserve (NAR) and the immediately adjacent Haleakala National Park (Baker 2001). One of three known individuals (male) was captured in September 2004 but died on 28 November 2004 (K. Swinnerton in litt. 2006, VanderWerf et al. 2006). The two other individuals may both have been male, but neither have been seen since 2003 and 2004 (K. Swinnerton in litt. 2006) and are likely to have now died (K. Swinnerton in litt. 2006). No other individuals have been located since 1998 despite almost constant presence of researchers in the field in recent years (K. Swinnerton in litt. 2006).",y,
Cichlocolaptes mazarbarnetti,"The Cryptic Treehunter was described in 2014, based on a specimen collected in 1986 (Mazar Barnett and Buzzetti 2014). The species has been found at only two sites in north east Brazil: Murici in Alagoas and Pedra d’Anta (Jaquiera) Reserve near Frei Caneca in Pernambuco (Pereira et al. 2014). Although the species inhabits a region where there is now a high level of observer awareness, searches in suitable habitat by professional ornithologists and a good number of park employees have produced no records since 2007 (Butchart et al. 2018). It has not been recorded since April 2007 in Murici and February 2005 in Pedra d’Anta (Pereira et al. 2014). Extensive habitat loss has occurred in the region, and the remaining fragments are small and isolated (Butchart et al. 2018). Following the application of new methods for estimating the probability of a species remaining extant (Akcakaya et al. 2017, Keith et al. 2017, Thompson et al. 2017) the probability of the species being extant was estimated at 0.018 based on records and surveys, and 0.083 based on threats (Butchart et al. 2018). Based on the probability thresholds recommended by Butchart et al. (2018), the species is now considered to be Extinct.",n,
Philydor novaesi,"Philydor novaesi has only ever been recorded at two sites in Alagoas and Pernambuco, north-east Brazil. It was first discovered at Murici (Alagoas) in 1979, when it was described as relatively conspicuous and easy to locate (Teixeira and Gonzaga 1983). Subsequent surveys found the species to be rare, and there were no confirmed records between 1992 and 1998. Single individuals were found in 1998 and 1999 (A. Whittaker in litt. 1999), and four birds in 2000 (J. Goerck in litt. 1999, 2000). It was discovered at Frei Caneca Private Reserve (Pernambuco) in April 2003 (Mazar Barnett et al. 2003, 2005), and at the adjacent Jaqueira (Frei Caneca) Reserve, where two individuals were observed in 2007/2008 (P. Develey in litt. 2007, 2008, 2009). Television footage of one individual was recorded in 2009 (P. Develey in litt. 2007, 2008, 2009), and the species could still be located at Frei Caneca in late 2010 and early 2011 (WikiAves n.d.). Despite extensive searches in both Frei Caneca and Murici, the species has not had a confirmed sighting since 2011 (Pereira et al. 2014). Following the application of new methods for estimating the probability of a species remaining extant (Akcakaya et al. 2017, Keith et al. 2017, Thompson et al. 2017), the probability of the species being extant was estimated at 0.074 based on records and surveys, and 0.059 based on threats (Butchart et al. 2018). Based on the probability thresholds recommended by Butchart et al. (2018), the species is now considered to be Extinct.",n,
Hemignathus lucidus,"Hemignathus lucidus was endemic to O'ahu in the Hawaiian Islands, U.S.A., but it went extinct around the end of the 19th century. Perkins found evidence that many individuals existed in the forests of Oahu in 1860, but no collectors found any trace of it in the 1890s (Munro 1960).",y,
Amazona martinicana,"Amazona martinicana was described from Martinique (to France) by Labat in 1742, and by Buffon in 1779, and named by Clark based on these descriptions. Labat wrote that ""the parrot is too common a bird for me to stop to give a description of it"" (Clark 1905), and so the species must have declined very rapidly to extinction in the latter half of the 18th century.",y,
Amazona violacea,"Amazona violacea, although not known from any specimens, was described in detail from Guadeloupe (to France) by, amongst others, Du Tertre in 1654 and 1667, Labat in 1742, and Brisson in 1760. It was named by Gmelin in 1789. In 1779 it was noted by Buffon to be very rare (Clark 1905), and presumably became extinct soon after.",y,
Ara tricolor,"Ara tricolor was endemic to mainland Cuba, and probably also the Isle of Pines (Walters 1995, Olson and Suárez 2008). There is no evidence for the historical existence of the species, or any other macaw, on Hispaniola (Olson 2005), where it has been erroneously suggested to occur (Wetherbee 1985). The last specimen was collected in 1864 (Bangs and Zappey 1905), with the last reports in 1885 (Lack 1976). At least 19 specimens (Moreno 1992) and three fossils (Olson and Suárez 2008) of the species exist.",y,
Psittacara labati,"Psittacara labati is not known from any specimens, but was well described by Labat in 1724 from Guadeloupe (to France) (Clark 1905a, b). Little is known of the species (Marien and Koopman 1955), but it must have declined to extinction in the second half of the 18th century. A suggestion that parakeets on Guadeloupe may have been escaped Cuban Parakeet Psittacara euops (Forshaw and Cooper 1989) is unlikely because the birds were not noted to have any red in the wing (Marien and Koopman 1955), unlike P. euops (Forshaw and Cooper 1989).",y,
Conuropsis carolinensis,"Conuropsis carolinensis was endemic to the eastern U.S.A., with the nominate race ranging from Florida to Virginia, and ludovicianus, through the Mississippi-Missouri drainage (Forshaw and Cooper 1989; Burgio et al. 2017, 2018). Birds were still common at the beginning of the 19th century but, in 1832, Audubon noted their decline, which followed increasing human settlement moving inland from the east (Saikku 1991). The last specimens were collected by Chapman near Lake Okeechobee, Florida, in 1904, although rumours of its survival persisted into the 1930s (McKinley 1985). The last captive bird died in the Cincinnati Zoo in 1918 (Joines 1985).",n,
Haematopus meadewaldoi,"Haematopus meadewaldoi was endemic to Fuerteventura, Lanzarote and their offshore islets in the Canary Islands, Spain (Collar et al. 1994). It was last collected in 1913 and locally reported to have become extinct by the 1940s (Collar and Stuart, 1985). It is now considered extinct because extensive surveys in the mid-1980s failed to find any evidence of the species's survival, despite four convincing reports (two from Tenerife and two from Senegal) between 1968 and 1981 (Collar et al. 1994).",y,
Pinguinus impennis,"Pinguinus impennis occurred in naturally scattered colonies (Bengtson 1984) across the North Atlantic until the 19th century, breeding from Canada through Greenland (to Denmark), the Faeroe Islands (to Denmark) and Iceland to Ireland and the UK, with archaeological records from the western coast of Europe from European Russia south to France (Bourne 1993), and wintering offshore south to New England, USA, and southern Spain (Montevecchi and Kirk 1996). The last known pair were killed on Eldey Island, Iceland, in 1844, and the last live bird was seen off the Newfoundland Banks in 1852 (Halliday 1979).",n,
Numenius tenuirostris,"The breeding range of this species is not well understood. The only confirmed breeding was near Tara, north Omsk in Siberia, Russia, between 1909 and 1925 (Gretton et al. 2002). Recent stable isotope analysis (Buchanan et al. 2018) has suggested that the majority of the species' breeding range was however to the south of this, centred on the Kazakh Steppe mostly in Kazakhstan.The species' non-breeding range was evidently much more extensive (e.g. Gretton 1991, BirdLife International 1999, Kirwan et al. 2015, Buchanan et al. 2025), but a full elucidation is hampered by identification difficulties (see Corso et al. 2014, Kirwan et al. 2015). For example, most records for the Middle East should now be considered doubtful (Kirwan et al. 2015, R. Porter in litt. 2025), but most specimen or photographed records are from what is assumed to have been the main wintering area in the Mediterranean Basin (Gretton 1991, Kirwan et al. 2008, 2015, Buchanan et al. 2025). The last-known wintering site for the species was Merga Zerga, in western Morocco, where the last sighting was on 23 February 1995 (van den Berg 1995). There have been no verified sightings of the species since, and it is now thought to be extinct (Buchanan et al. 2025).",n,
Riccordia elegans,"Chlorostilbon elegans, described from a single specimen in the Natural History Museum at Tring by Gould in 1860, was recently shown by Weller (1999) to be a valid species. It is extinct, but is inferred to possibly have occurred in Jamaica or the north Bahamas.",y,
Aegolius gradyi,"Aegolius gradyi is known only from Bermuda. It was described from fossil remains by Olson (2012) who, in reviewing accounts dating from the early 1600s, considers it likely to have persisted into the historic period.",y,
Colaptes oceanicus,Colaptes oceanicus was described from subfossil remains from Bermuda by Olson (2013). He reviewed historic accounts and regarded the species as likely to have persisted into the colonial period in the 1600s.,y,
Caracara lutosa,"Caracara lutosa was endemic to Isla Guadalupe, Mexico. It was last recorded in 1903 and is now extinct (Howell and Cade 1953).",y,
Anas theodori,"The species was endemic to Mauritius, and is known from a number of explorers' accounts (Cheke 1987), and bones (Cowles 1987). Although in 1681, the ""gray teal"" was found in ""great numbers"" it was becoming rare by 1693, and was last mentioned as extant in 1696. There are also numerous travellers' reports of sarcelles and canards from Réunion, and so presumably this or a similar species also occurred there, where they were extinct by 1710 at latest, although no bones have been found (Cheke 1987).",y,
Tachybaptus rufolavatus,"Tachybaptus rufolavatus was endemic to Madagascar and known chiefly from Lake Alaotra (ZICOMA 1999). There have been no confirmed sightings since 1985 when two were seen (in addition to several apparent hybrids) near Andreba on Lake Alaotra in September 1985 (Hawkins et al. 2000, P. Thompson in litt. 2022). After this an adult and an immature were reported as the species in 1986 (B. Dawson, unpublished report) and two individuals (also an adult and an immature) which may have been Alaotra Grebe were again reported in 1988 (D. Thorn, unpublished report) but these were not documented and may have been hybrids (Hawkins et al. 2000). Survey visits to Lake Alaotra in 1989-90 (Young and Smith 1989, Wilmé 1994) 1993 and 1994 (Pidgeon 1996), then 1997-1999 failed to produce any sightings, prompting a targeted survey in 1999 which only located four T. pelzelnii (ZICOMA 1999, Hawkins et al. 2000). Visits in 2000 found no individuals (of this or any species of Tachybaptus) on Lake Alaotra or surrounding lakes, and further surveys drew blanks in 2004 and 2009 (H. G. Young in litt. 2009). Records outside the Lake Alaotra region were unreliable as species was probably incapable of prolonged flight, so in all likelihood never occurred very far from Lake Alaotra (ZICOMA 1999, Hawkins et al. 2000). Checks of additional potential sites, in particular Lake Amparihinandriamabavy (F. Hawkins in litt. 2009), have failed to find any grebes. It is now considered extinct, as no suitable wetlands remain unsurveyed in the Alaotra region (H. G. Young in litt. 2009).",y,
Pipilo naufragus,This extinct taxon was known only from Bermuda.,y,
Quiscalus palustris,"Quiscalus palustris had a small distribution in the Lerma marshlands, in the state of México, Mexico (Dickerman 1965), and probably also in Xochimilco in the Valley of Mexico (Peterson 1998). It was last recorded in 1910 (Stattersfield et al. 1998), and presumably became extinct soon after (Hardy 1967).",n,
Hemignathus affinis,"Hemignathus affinis was endemic to Maui in the Hawaiian Islands, U.S.A. It was found on the eastern and north-eastern slopes of Haleakala, in Hosmer's Grove and Waikamoi Preserve and from the Hanawi drainage east to Kipahulu Valley (Pratt and Pyle 2000). There have been no other confirmed sightings since 1996 despite extensive effort in a large proportion of the historic range, including annual surveys by the National Park Service (NPS), two State sanctioned surveys, monthly surveys in Hanawi, The Nature Conservancy (TNC) surveys and efforts by the Maui Forest Bird Recovery team. Although not all of these programmes surveyed locations where the species was last observed, many surveyed highly likely locations (Pratt and Pyle 2000, R. Camp in litt. 2003).",y,
Podilymbus gigas,"Podilymbus gigas was endemic to Lake Atitlán, Guatemala (LaBastille 1974). ",n,duck
Podiceps andinus,"Podiceps andinus was restricted to the Bogotá wetlands at c.2,600 m in the Eastern Andes of Colombia.",n,duck
Camptorhynchus labradorius,"Camptorhynchus labradorius probably bred along the Gulf of St Lawrence and coastal Labrador, Canada, wintering from Nova Scotia south to Florida, USA (Gourdin 2009). The last confirmed specimen was collected off Long Island, New York, in 1875 (Chilton 1997), or possibly 1878 (Madge and Burn 1988).",n,
Nyctanassa carcinocatactes,"Nyctanassa carcinocatactes is known from subfossil remains from Bermuda (Olson and Wingate 2006). Reports from 1610 refer to numerous herons fitting the likely description of this species (Hume and Walters 2012), but it probably became Extinct during the early 17th century shortly after colonisation by humans.",y,
Dromaius minor,"Dromaius ater was endemic to King Island in the Bass Strait, Australia (Stattersfield et al. 1998). Numerous skeletal remains have been found, but only one skin exists, collected by Baudin in 1802 and now in Paris (Jouanin 1959). The species' extinction must have followed shortly thereafter (Hume and Walters 2012).",y,
Dromaius baudinianus,"Dromaius baudinianus was endemic to Kangaroo Island, off South Australia, Australia (Stattersfield et al. 1998). Writing in 1837, Leigh reported that birds had not been seen for 10 years (Marchant and Higgins 1991) and the last recorded sighting was in 1819 (Hume and Walters 2012). An egg was apparently collected in 1830 and the species is thought to have succumbed to hunting pressure some years before the arrival of permanent settlers in 1836 (Hume and Walters 2012).",y,
Mergus australis,"Mergus australis was restricted to the Auckland Islands, New Zealand, by the time of its discovery in 1840 (Stattersfield et al. 1998), but subfossil remains of a Mergus species have also been found on South and Stewart Islands. At least 26 specimens were collected in total, the last in 1902 (Kear and Scarlett 1970); there have been no records since, despite intensive searches (Williams and Weller 1974).",y,
Coturnix novaezelandiae,"Coturnix novaezelandiae was endemic to North, South and Great Barrier Islands, New Zealand (Marchant and Higgins 1993). It was considered fairly common until the mid-19th century, but declined rapidly to extinction by 1875 (Holdaway 1999). Suggestions that a quail population on Tiritiri Matangi Island may be a surviving form of this species were disproven by genetic testing, showing them to be Brown Quail Synoicus ypsilophorus (Seabrook-Davison et al. 2009).",y,
Chenonetta finschi,"Chenonetta finschi was endemic to New Zealand, where it was abundant and widespread throughout the eastern drylands of the North and South Islands (Adams 2013).",y,
Pampusana ferruginea,"This species is known only from J. R. Forster's 1774 painting, from Tanna Island, Vanuatu, in the Natural History Museum at Tring (Knox and Walters 1994).",y,
Ptilinopus mercierii,"Ptilinopus mercierii was endemic to the Marquesas, French Polynesia, with the nominate subspecies on Nuku Hiva and subspecies tristrami on Hiva Oa. While the former is known from a single specimen collected in 1849 in the Valley of Mohana, Nuka Hiva (Hume 2017), the latter is known from at least 11 specimens, the last collected by the Whitney Expedition in 1922 (Holyoak and Thibault 1984). The species was reported on Hiva Oa in 1980 (Hay 1986), but this was probably a mistake (Collar et al. 1994).",y,
Diaphorapteryx hawkinsi,"Diaphorapteryx hawkinsi was endemic to the Chatham Islands, New Zealand, where its remains have been found on the main Chatham Island and Pitt Island. Available evidence, including a letter from Sigvard Jacob Dannefaerd to Lord Lionel Walter Rothschild in 1895 describing the species' appearance, behaviour and Moriori hunting method, suggests that this species survived into at least the late 1800s.",y,
Columba jouyi,"Columba jouyi was endemic to Okinawa and Kerama, and the Daito Islands, in the Nansei Shoto Islands, Japan (Stattersfield et al. 1998). It was described in 1887 from a type in the Tokyo Educational Museum (Stejneger 1887), and is also known from three skins in the Natural History Museum at Tring (Knox and Walters 1994). It apparently declined rapidly (and inexplicably), and was last recorded on Okinawa in 1904, and on Daito in 1936 (Stattersfield et al. 1998).",y,
Carpodacus ferreorostris,"Carpodacus ferreorostris is an Extinct taxon only known from specimens collected in 1827 and 1828 on Chichi-jima, Ogasawara-shoto (Peel Island, Bonin), Japan (Brazil 1991). It could not be found on Peel by Simpson in 1854, and rumours that it may have survived until 1890, when it was reported to Holst by locals (Morioka 1992), were never substantiated (Brazil 1991).",y,
Cabalus modestus,"Cabalus modestus was endemic to Chatham, Mangere and Pitt Islands, New Zealand. It was first discovered on Mangere in 1871, and 26 specimens collected there are known from museum collections. The last known specimen was taken between 1895 and 1900 (Hume 2017). The species is also known from 19th century bones from Chatham and Pitt Islands.",y,
Hypotaenidia poeciloptera,"Hypotaenidia poeciloptera was known from Fiji, with twelve 19th century specimens from Vitu Levu and Ovalau (Taylor and van Perlo 1998) and it was last seen with certainty in 1890 (Hume 2017). There have been reports from Taveuni (Blackburn 1971) in 1971 and Waisa, Vitu Levu, in 1973 (Holyoak 1979), although these remain unconfirmed (Hume 2017). There have been no convincing recent reports from Ovalau or Taveuni which remain mongoose-free and where other rail species were recorded during field surveys and other fieldwork in 2002-2005, and so it is highly likely that H. poeciloptera is extinct (G. Dutson in litt. 2005).",y,
Hypotaenidia wakensis,"Hypotaenidia wakensis was endemic to Wake and Wilkes Islands in the central Pacific Ocean, United States Minor Outlying Islands (to U.S.A.). Although it was not uncommon before the Second World War, it was extinct by 1946 (Greenway 1967).",y,
Hypotaenidia dieffenbachii,"Hypotaenidia dieffenbachii was endemic to Chatham, Mangere and Pitt Islands, New Zealand (Marchant and Higgins 1993). It is known from the type specimen in the Natural History Museum at Tring, U. K. (Knox and Walters 1994), and from abundant subfossil material (Tennyson and Millener 1994). The species was already scarce when the type was collected in 1840 (Marchant and Higgins 1993) and is likely to have become extinct around this time (Hume 2017).",y,
Hypotaenidia pacifica,"Hypotaenidia pacifica is known only from Georg Forster's painting from Tahiti, French Polynesia, in the British Museum London (Knox and Walters 1994), from James Cook's second voyage in 1773, although there were reports from Tahiti until 1844, and from the nearby Mehetia until the 1930s (Bruner 1972).",y,
Zapornia palmeri,"Zapornia palmeri was found on Laysan Island, Hawai'i, U.S.A. (Baldwin 1947), from where it became extinct between 1923 and 1936 (Taylor and van Perlo 1998). Birds were introduced to Pearl and Hermes Reef in 1929 but none were found in 1930 (Hume 2017). Birds were introduced to Eastern and Sand Islands in the Midway Atoll, with failed re-introductions also reportedly attempted to Lisianski, Laysan and to the main Hawaiian group (Taylor and van Perlo 1998). It became extinct on Sand Island in 1943 and Eastern Island in 1944 (Baldwin 1945).",y,
Zapornia sandwichensis,"Zapornia sandwichensis occurred on Hawai'i, U.S.A., and may also have occurred on Molokai (Pratt et al. 1987). It is known from bones and a number of specimens (Olson and James 1991), and was illustrated by William Wade Ellis on James Cook's third voyage (Stresemann 1950). The last specimen was collected in 1864 (Taylor and van Perlo 1998).",y,
Zapornia nigra,"Zapornia nigra is known from two illustrations, one by Georg Forster from Tahiti, French Polynesia, from James Cook's second voyage (1772-1775), and the other by John Frederick Miller from 1784, and by subsequent descriptions by John Latham and Johann Friedrich Gmelin. It presumably became extinct soon after (Walters 1988). The species also possibly occurred on Mangaia (Hume 2017).",y,
Prosobonia leucoptera,"Prosobonia leucoptera was endemic to Tahiti, in the Society Islands, French Polynesia (Pratt et al. 1987). The type was collected by Johann Forster and painted by his son in 1773; the specimen is now in Leiden and the painting in London (Walters 1994). Another specimen, now lost, was taken in 1777 (Greenway 1967).",y,
Zapornia monasa,"Zapornia monasa was endemic to Kosrae, Caroline Islands, Federated States of Micronesia. Heinrich von Kittlitz collected the only two known specimens (now in St Petersburg, Russia) in 1827-1828, and regarded the species as uncommon even then (Taylor 1998). It declined to extinction over the next half-century.",y,
Porphyrio paepae,"Porphyrio paepae was known from Hiva Oa and Tahuata on the Marquesas Islands (French Polynesia). It may have survived as late as 1937, but must have become extinct soon afterwards (Steadman 1988, Hume and Walters 2012).",y,
Porphyrio kukwiedei,"Porphyrio kukwiedei is known only from subfossil remains from New Caledonia (to France). However, a passage from Verreaux and des Murs written in 1860 notes the presence of birds the size of turkeys in marshy areas, and so it is possible that the species survived into the 19th century (Balouet and Olson 1989).",y,
Porphyrio mantelli,"Porphyrio mantelli was a flightless endemic to North Island, New Zealand, from where it is known from subfossils from a number of archeological sites (Williams 1960) and from one possible late 19th century record (Phillipps 1959).",y,
Tribonyx hodgenorum,"Tribonyx hodgenorum is known from subfossil remains on the North and South Islands of New Zealand. It was apparently widespread, but the youngest specimen material dates from the 17th century. However, it may have survived in remote areas until the 18th century (Hume 2017).",y,
Ixobrychus novaezelandiae,"Ixobrychus novaezelandiae was endemic to New Zealand, known from North and South Island (Hume 2017).",y,
Moho apicalis,"Moho apicalis was restricted to forest on O'ahu, Hawai'i, USA (Pratt et al. 1987). It is known only from around seven specimens, the last three of which were collected by Ferdinand Deppe in the hills behind Honolulu in 1837. None of the collectors visiting O'ahu between 1890 and 1900 found any trace of it (Greenway 1967), and it is now considered Extinct.",y,
Moho bishopi,"Moho bishopi was a forest bird endemic to the Hawaiian Islands, USA (Pratt et al. 1987). It was last recorded on Moloka'i in 1904 by Munro (1944), who received local reports of its survival until 1915, but could find no more birds despite numerous further searches up until 1949. There is very little historical information about its occurrence on Maui, and although a single bird believed to be this species was observed in 1981 on the north-east slope of Haleakala (Sabo 1982), there have been no further confirmed records despite intensive searching (Collar et al. 1994) and the species is presumed extinct (Reynolds and Snetsinger 2001).",y,
Moho nobilis,"Moho nobilis was only found in forest on the Big Island of Hawai`i, USA (Pratt et al. 1987). It was last collected in 1902 but there was an unconfirmed record in 1934 (Munro 1944, Hume 2017).",y,
Chaetoptila angustipluma,"Chaetoptila angustipluma is known historically only from the Big Island of Hawaii, USA. Only four specimens were ever collected, between 1840 and 1859 (Greenway 1967).",y,
Moho braccatus,"Moho braccatus was endemic to Kaua'i, Hawaii, USA. It was common in the 1890s, but declined drastically during the early 20th century (Pratt et al. 1987). By the 1970s, it was confined to the Alaka'i Wilderness Preserve (Pratt 1994). In 1981, a single pair remained, the female of which was not found after Hurricane Iwa in 1982, the male being last seen in 1985. The last possible report, of vocalisations only, was in 1987, and the species has not been recorded during subsequent surveys of Alaka'i (Conant et al. 1998, Hume 2017).",y,
Turnagra capensis,"Turnagra capensis, according to Walter Buller, was common until 1863 on the South Island, New Zealand, from where it is known from numerous specimens (Greenway 1967). However, the species declined very rapidly in the 1880s, and the definite record was from 1905 (Tennyson and Martinson 2006). There have been unconfirmed reports since, including in 1963 (Knox and Walters 1994).",y,
Turnagra tanagra,"Turnagra tanagra was endemic to the North Island, New Zealand. Walter Buller described it as common in the 1870s, but there were few specimens ever collected (specimens are only known to exist in Chicago, Philadelphia (USA), Tring (U.K.) and Wellington (New Zealand)), the last being from 1902. Occasional unconfirmed sight records persisted until 1970 (Tennyson and Martinson 2006).",y,
Zosterops conspicillatus,"Zosterops conspicillatus was formerly found on Guam, last recorded in 1983 and is now extinct (del Hoyo et al. 2008). The introduction of the Brown Tree Snake Boiga irregularis is the most likely cause (van Balen 2016, Hume 2017).",y,
Myiagra freycineti,"Myiagra freycineti was endemic to Guam (to USA), where it was once common but restricted to the northern plateau by the 1970s (Jenkins 1983, Hume 2017).",y,
Pomarea pomarea,"Pomarea pomarea is known only from the type specimen, collected on Maupiti, Society Islands, French Polynesia, by Jules de Blosseville in 1823 (Holyoak and Thibault 1984). It presumably became extinct soon after, as it has not been recorded since.",y,
Turdus ravidus,"Turdus ravidus is known from four collections (21 specimens in total) from Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands (to UK). The last specimens were collected (by W. W. Brown) in 1911 (Bangs 1916), and the last sight record (by C. B. Lewis) was in 1938 (Johnston 1969). It was extinct by 1965 (Bradley 2000).",y,
Cyanoramphus ulietanus,"Cyanoramphus ulietanus is only known from two specimens from Raiatea, French Polynesia (Forshaw and Cooper 1989), likely collected on James Cook's voyage in 1773 or 1774, and now in Vienna (Austria) and Tring (U.K.) (Knox and Walters 1994, Hume 2017).",y,
Nestor productus,"Nestor productus was endemic to Norfolk Island (to Australia) and adjacent Phillip Island, Australia. It became extinct in the wild in the mid-19th century on Norfolk Island, and possibly a little later on Phillip Island. The last known living bird was in captivity in London in 1851 (Garnett et al. 2011). At least seven specimens exist (Forshaw and Cooper 1989).",y,
Cyanoramphus zealandicus,"Cyanoramphus zealandicus is known from Tahiti, French Polynesia, from three specimens (two of which are now in Liverpool and one in Tring, U. K.) collected on James Cook's voyage in 1773, a fourth collected by G. Amadis in 1842, now in Perpignan (France) and a fifth collected by M. J. de Marolles in 1844, now in Paris (France) (Voisin et al. 1995).",y,
Psephotellus pulcherrimus,"Psephotellus pulcherrimus was found in eastern Australia, only reported with certainty from southeastern Queensland. Claims from the north of the state are likely to have been mistaken. The species is also often said to have been found in New South Wales, but there have been no confirmed records (Olsen 2007). It was locally common although generally scarce in the 19th century (Forshaw and Cooper 1989), but then declined rapidly and was thought to have become extinct as a result of the drought of 1902 until it was rediscovered in 1918 (Chisholm 1922). The last confirmed observation was in 1927 (Hume 2017). Some credible reports continued into the 1930s and '40s (Olsen 2007), but although Kiernan (1993) claims to have seen five birds in 1990, the species is now considered Extinct (Collar et al. 1994).",n,
Aplonis fusca,"Aplonis fusca was endemic to Norfolk Island (to Australia) and Lord Howe Island, Australia (Garnett 1992). On Lord Howe Island, the population of subspecies hulliana tumbled to extinction from numbering thousands in 1913-1915 - it was not seen after 1918 and was certainly extinct by 1928 (Sharland 1929, Hindwood 1940, Garnett 1992). The nominate subspecies on Norfolk Island was last recorded in 1923 (Garnett 1992), although its absence was not noted until 1968 (Smithers and Disney 1969).",y,
